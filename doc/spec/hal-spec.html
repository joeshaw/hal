>&#13;	This document concerns the specification of HAL which is a
	piece of software that provides a view of the various hardware
	attached to a system. In addition to this, HAL keeps detailed
	metadata for each piece of hardware and provide hooks such
	that system- and desktop-level software can react to changes
	in the hardware configuration in order to maintain system
	policy.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	HAL represents a piece of hardware as a 
	<I
CLASS="emphasis"
>device object</I
>. A device object is
	identified by a unique identifer and carries a set of
	key/value paris referred to as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>device
	properties</I
>. Some properties are derived from the
	actual hardware, some are merged from <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>device
	information files</I
> and some are related to the
	actual device configuration. This document specifies the set
	of device properties and gives them well-defined meaning. This
	enable system and desktop level components to distinguish
	between the different device objects and discover and
	configure devices based on these properties.

      </P
><P
>&#13;	
	HAL provides an easy-to-use API through D-BUS which is an IPC
	framework that, among other things, provides a system-wide
	message-bus that allows applications to talk to one
	another. Specifically, D-BUS provides asynchronous
	notification such that HAL can notify other peers on the
	message-bus when devices are added and removed as well as when
	properties on a device are changing.  

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	The most important goal of HAL is to provide plug-and-play
	facilities for UNIX-like desktops with focus on providing a
	rich and extensible description of device characteristics and
	features. HAL has no other major dependencies apart from D-BUS
	which, given sufficient infrastructure, allows it to be
	implemented on many UNIX-like systems. The major focus,
	initially, is systems running the Linux 2.6 series kernels.

          A system-wide daemon that maintains a persistent database of
          device objects. The daemon is also responsible for merging
          information from the device information file repository and
          managing the life cycle of device objects. The HAL daemon
          also contains detection and monitoring code for
          buses (such as PCI and USB buses) and devices (such as
          networking and storage devices). The HAL daemon notifies system
          level components through callouts and session level
          components using the D-BUS interface.

            This represents the end consumers of the HAL and comprises
            both applications that need to search for a device, but
            also (existing) device specific libraries and/or services
            that provide access to devices. Specifically, the
            application or device library can obtain the ''address''
            (the special device file or other details), of the device
            through HAL, to interact with the device through the
            kernel as usual.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
            In addition, this group include desktop environments such
            as GNOME or KDE. Specifically, using HAL, desktop
            environments may include session-level daemons enforcing
            certain policies when the device database managed by the
            HAL daemon changes. Such policies may include starting a
            photo management application when a camera is plugged in,
            assisting the user in finding driver software and device
            information files for a new device, displaying link status
            information about network devices, mounting removable
            storage and so on.

          </P
><P
>&#13;
	    Note that several desktop sessions may be active on the
	    same system; it is the responsibility of session-level
	    software to arbitrate the device access between sessions.

></P
><P
> 

	    Callouts are programs invoked when the device object list
	    is modified or when a device property changes. As such, callouts
	    can be used to maintain system-wide policy (that may be
	    specific to the particular OS) such as changing
	    permissions on device nodes, updating the
	    systemwide <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> file or
	    configuring the networking subsystem.

      The HAL uses D-BUS to provide a ''network API'' to
      applications. As D-BUS is designed to be language independent,
      potentially many languages / runtime systems will be able to
      easily access the services offered by HAL. The D-BUS API is
      detailed in <A
HREF="#dbus-api"
>the chapter called <I
>D-BUS Network API</I
></A
>. Note that HAL doesn't
      enforce any policy at all, this is left for desktop environments
      and operating systems vendors to implement.  However, to ensure
      interoperability between operating systems and desktop
      environments, recommendations and best practises on how to
      enforce policy is discussed in <A
HREF="#enforcing-policy"

>Device Objects</H1
><P
>&#13;
	It is important to precisely define the term HAL device
	object. It's actually a bit blurry to define in general, it
	includes what most UNIX-like systems consider first class
	objects when it comes to hardware. In particular, a device
	object should represent the smallest unit of addressable
	hardware. This means there can be a one-to-many relationship
	between a physical device and the device objects exported by
	HAL. Specifically, a multi-function printer, which appear to
	users as a single device may show up as several device
	objects; e.g. one HAL device object for each of the printing,
	scanning, fax and storage interfaces. Conversely, some devices
	may be implemented such that the HAL device object represent
	several functional interfaces. HAL is not concerned with this
	duality of either one-to-many or many-to-one relationships
	between device objects and the actual iron constituting what
	users normally understand as a single piece of hardware;
	a device object represents the smallest addressable unit.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	Device objects in HAL are organised on a by-connection basis,
	e.g. for a given device object X it is possible to find the
	device object Y where X is attached to Y. This gives structure
	to the device database of HAL; it is possible to map the
	devices out in a tree. Further, software emulation devices
	exported by a kernel, such as SCSI emulation for USB Storage
	Devices, are also considered device objects in HAL. This
	implies that kernel specific bits leak into the device object
	database. However users of HAL won't notice, such device
	objects are not referenced anywhere in the device objects that
	users are interested in; they are merely used as glue to build
	the device tree.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	In addition to provide information about what kind of hardware
	a device object represents (such as a PCI or USB device) and
	how to address it, HAL merges information about the functional
	interfaces the OS kernel provides in order to use the device;
	in most cases this is represented on the device object as a
	string property with the name of the special device file in
	<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/dev</TT
>. In addition to the special device
	file, a number of other useful properties are merged. This
	means that both hardware and functional properties are on the
	same device object, which is very useful for an application
	programmer. For example, an application might query HAL for
	the device object that exports the special device file
	<TT
CLASS="literal"
>/dev/input/mouse2</TT
> and learn that this is
	provide by an USB mouse from a certain manufacturer by
	checking the properties that export the USB vendor and product
	identifiers.  See <A
HREF="#device-capabilities"
>the chapter called <I
>Device Capabilities</I
></A
> and
	<A
HREF="#device-properties"
>the chapter called <I
>Device Properties</I

> for details.

          This is an identifier, the Unique Device Identifer, that is
          unique for a device object - that is, no other device object
          can have the same UDI at the same time.  The UDI is computed
          using bus-specific information and is meant to be unique
          across device insertions and independent of the physical
          port or slot the device may be plugged into.

	The first category is determined by HAL, the next is merged
	from either the hardware itself or device information files
	and the last is intercepted by monitoring the operating
	system.  This specification is concerned with precisely
	defining several properties; see <A
HREF="#device-properties"
>the chapter called <I
>Device Properties</I
></A
> and onwards for more
	information.  As a complement to device properties, HAL also
	provides <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>conditions</I
> on HAL device
	objects. Conditions are used to relay events that are
	happening on devices which are not easily expressed in
	properties. This includes events such as ''processor is
	overheating'' or ''block device unmounted''.

      </P
><P
>&#13;
	The fundamental idea about HAL is that all ''interesting''
	information about hardware that a desktop application needs,
	can be obtained by querying HAL. Below is a screenshot of a
	simple device manager application shipped with HAL
	called <TT
CLASS="literal"
>hal-device-manager</TT
>.  This
	application is communicating with the HAL daemon and displays
	the tree of device objects. The shown properties are for a
	device object representing a harddisk.

       Mainstream hardware isn't very good at reporting what they are,
       they only report, at best, how to interact with them. This is a
       problem; many devices, such as MP3 players or digital still
       cameras, appear to the operating system as plain USB Mass
       Storage devices when they in fact are a lot more than just
       that. The core of the problem is that without external
       metadata, the operating system and desktop environment will
       present it to the user as just e.g. a mass storage device.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       As HAL is concerned with merging of external metadata, through
       e.g. device information files, there needs to be some scheme on
       how to record what the device actually is. This is achieved by
       two textual properties, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>info.category</TT
> and
       <TT
CLASS="literal"
>info.capabilities</TT
>. The former describes
       <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>what the device is</I
> (as a single
       alphanumeric keyword) and the latter describes
       <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>what the device does</I
> (as a number of
       alphanumeric keywords separated by whitespace). The keywords
       available for use is defined in this document; we'll refer to
       them in following simply as <I
CLASS="emphasis"
>capabilities</I
>.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       HAL itself, assigns capabilities on device detection time by
       inspecting the device class (if available, it depends on the
       bus type) and looking at information from the operating system
       (most OS'es have a concept of device classes). At this time the
       category is also determined by selecting the most prominent
       capability. However, both capabilities and category can be
       overridden by either device information files or callouts. This
       gives maximum flexibility, while maintaining a base level of
       capability detection.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       The idea of HAL is that existing device capability specific
       libraries (such as libghoto2), would advertise what kind of HAL
       capabilities they are able to handle. As this happens over
       time, this specification will grow to precisely define what a
       device with a given capability is supposed to do and what
       library, or service, the application programmer can use to
       access the device.
     
     </P
><P
>&#13;
       Having a capability also means that part of the property
       namespace, prefixed with the capability name, will be populated
       with more specific information about the capability. Indeed,
       some properties may even be required such that applications and
       device libraries have something to expect. For instance, the
       capability for being a MP3 player may require properties
       defining what audio formats the device support, whether it
       support recording of audio, and how to interact with the
       device. For example, the latter may specify ''USB Storage
       Device'' or ''proprietary protocol, use libfooplayer''.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       Just as device objects can appear and disappear at any time
       (e.g. when a device is plugged in respectively removed),
       capabilities can also appear and disappear - one example of
       this happening is when device drivers are loaded and unloaded.

     </P
><P
>&#13;
       Finally, capabilities have an inheritance scheme, e.g. if a device
       has a capability <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo.bar</TT
>, it must also have
       the capability <TT
CLASS="literal"
>foo</TT
>.

      While the HAL daemon provides generic operations that apply to
      all devices (though some may be no-ops), HAL is not concerned
      with providing non-generic device operations. Specifically, one
      goal of HAL is to integrate with existing and future libraries
      that target a specific class of devices such as cameras or mp3
      players.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      For instance, <TT
CLASS="literal"
>libgphoto2</TT
> could be extended
      such that the application programmer can simply pass the UDI of
      the camera he wishes to interact with
      and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>libghoto2</TT
> would then, via D-BUS, acquire
      the bus-specific information required, the address so to speak,
      from the HAL daemon, and then interact directly with the
      hardware.

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      Another option is to use the existing API of the device library
      to discover devices (the library would be using HAL under the
      hood) and provide a function to retrieve the HAL UDI of the
      device. When the library is built without HAL support this
      function returns <TT
CLASS="literal"
>NULL</TT
>, however, when the UDI
      is available, then applications using the library can use the
      UDI both as stable reference to the device and also to extract
      more information directly from the HAL daemon.

>Device Information Files</H1

>&#13;
      Device information files (<TT
CLASS="literal"
>.fdi</TT
> files is a
      shorthand) are used to merge arbitrary properties onto device
      objects. The way device information files works is that once all
      physical properties are merged onto a device object it is tried
      against the set of installed device information files.  

    </P
><P
>&#13;
      Each device information file got a number of
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>&#60;match key="some_property"
      [string|int|bool|..]="required_value" &#62;</TT
> directives
      that is tested against the properties of the device object. If
      all the match directives passes then the device information can
      include <TT
CLASS="literal"
>&#60;merge key="some_property"
      type="[string|int|bool|..]"&#62;</TT
> directives to merge
      new properties onto the device object. It's important to
      emphasize that any previously property stemming from device
      detection can be overridden by a device information file.

      Callouts are programs invoked when the device object list is
      modified or when a device changes. As such, callouts can be used
      to maintain system-wide policy (that may be specific to the
      particular OS) such as changing permissions on device nodes,
      updating the systemwide <TT
CLASS="literal"
>/etc/fstab</TT
> file or
      configuring the networking subsystem.
      
    </P
><P
>&#13;      
      There are three different classes of callouts. A callout
      involves sequentially invoking all executable programs in a
      given directory in alphabetic order.

      All callouts execute in the same environment as which the HAL
      daemon was started. In addition, the UDI of the device object is
      exported in the environment variable <TT
CLASS="literal"
>UDI</TT
>. All
      properties of the device object are exported in the environment
      prefixed with <TT
CLASS="literal"
>HAL_</TT
>. The HAL daemon isn't
      suspended while callouts are executing. Thus, callouts can
      communicate with the HAL daemon using the D-BUS network
      API. Hence, one application of callouts is to merge or modify
      properties on a device object.

      The HAL daemon is a system-wide process that keeps track of a
      number of device objects. It communicates with the operating
      system and intercepts hotplug events as devices are plugged in
      and removed.  The daemon is also responsible for providing
      services to applications that wants to locate devices and
      perform generic operations on them such as obtaining exclusive
      access.  Non-generic operations, such as obtaining pictures from
      a camera device, is outside the scope of the HAL daemon; see
      <A
HREF="#using-devices"

>Using devices</I
></A

      HAL has the concept of device stores. When a device is detected
      it is placed in the TDL (temporary device list) and then properties
      are merged from several sources including device information files
      and possibly callouts. Eventually, the device transitions to the
      GDL (global device list) and first then it becomes ''visible'' for 
      desktop applications.
