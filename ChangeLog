	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-storage.c: (main): Switch EjectButton
	event detection to SG_IO interface. This should solve problems with
	some SCSI drives and be the better interface anyway. For details see:
		https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=145147

2006-01-26  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	uevent buffer size is going to be increased.

2006-01-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: For providing eject

	our allowed paths are now in $PATH

	* hald-runner/main.c (main): Print out allowed paths

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (add_blockdev_probing_helper_done): Fix up

2006-01-21  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald-runner/runner.c: Search $PATH before searching allowed dirs;
	this is needed to make e.g. run-hald.sh work - note that passing
	"/bin/sh /path/to/evil/program" will _not_ work as we don't do
	shell-ish stuff. Also, don't force working dir to be "/" for
	same reasons.	

	* hald/property.h: Export hal_property_strlist_clear

	* hald/property.c (hal_property_strlist_clear): New function

	(get_disc_capacity_for_type): Add probing for disc capacity.

	Fixes fd.o bug #2233

2006-01-20  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (device_query_capability): Yesterday while unit
	testing my HAL wrapper I noticed that calling QueryCapability make
	hald to quit. I looked at hald code and found the issues, you'll
	find a patch attached that makes QueryCapability to work correctly
	again. Basically it wasn't able to retrieve the capability
	list (string vs string list) and the requested capability was
	free'd when it shouldn't. Patch from Kevin Ottens <ervin@kde.org>.

2006-01-20  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: Add Eject method
	for audio CD's. Patch from John Palmieri <johnp@redhat.com>.

2006-01-20  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Great patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>: As most people
	probably know by now, various people don't really like that hal
	running as root. We'd much rather see only a small process running
	as root and the main hal process running unpriviledged. Which is
	exactly what this patch does :)

	How does it work? Just before drops it's root privs. a small
	program is startup which will remain running as root and does the
	real execution of the addons/probes/callouts on hals
	behalf. Communication between hald and hald-runner is done via a
	p2p dbus connection. Resulting in a process tree like this:

	  hal       /usr/sbin/hald
	  root      \_ /usr/lib/hal/hald-runner
	  root          \_ /usr/lib/hal/hald-addon-acpi
	  root          \_ /usr/lib/hal/hald-addon-storage
	  root          \_ /usr/lib/hal/hald-addon-storage

	The patch consists out of two parts. First the implementation of
	hald-runner, which is about 700 lines of code. And then a part
	transforming the hald code from the current spawning code in utils
	to an interface that can talk to the runner.

	* AUTHORS: Add Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>. Revise my own
	email address.

	* configure.in (AC_OUTPUT): Add hald-runner

	* Makefile.am (SUBDIRS): Add hald-runner

	* hald/Makefile.am (hald_SOURCES): add hald_runner.[ch]

	* hald-runner/utils.c, hald-runner/utils.h, hald-runner/runner.c,
	hald-runner/runner.h, hald-runner/main.c, hald-runner/Makefile.am,

	hald/linux2/blockdev.c, hald/util.[ch], hald/hald_dbus.c,
	hald/hald.c, hald/hald_runner.[ch]: New and changed files with
	slight changes. See the descriptive text above and discussion at
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/hal/2006-January/004327.html
	for details. 
	Changed function hald_runner_start_runner() in hald/hald_runner.c
	to print out runner path and improve error handling when runner
	is not found. Also removed dbus_server_unref (server) in 
	handle_connection() in same file.

	* hald/haldaemon.in: Remove --retain-privileges as this is no longer
	needed

	* hald/run-hald.sh, hald/debug-hald.sh, hald/valgrind-hald.sh:
	Remove --retain-privileges and use --with-runner pointing to
	../hald-runner/hald-runner

	storage device instead of using the "device" link in sysfs.

2006-01-18  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-pmu.c (main): Use a direct connection to
	the bus; sleep between writing and reading as otherwise we may get
	EAGAIN. Handle EAGAIN by just trying again later.

2006-01-17  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Post-release version bump to 0.5.7

	* tools/hal-system-storage-eject: Ugh, fix speling error UnknowFailure
	to UnknownFailure in exception

====== HAL 0.5.6 released ======

2006-01-16  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update for 0.5.6

2006-01-16  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-storage.c: (main): relaced usage of
	strtok with g_strsplit_set.

2006-01-16  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* tools/hal-system-power-hibernate, tools/hal-system-power-suspend:
	Changed call of powersave fom call binary to call powersave dbus 
	interface to be able to differ between root and normal user (patch
	from Holger Macht <hmacht@suse.de>) if HAL run as root.

2006-01-16  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: added storage.cdrom.write_speeds to spec 

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-storage.c, 
	hald/linux2/probing/linux_dvd_rw_utils.h, 
	hald/linux2/probing/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c: (int_compare),
	(get_write_speeds), (get_read_write_speed): added slightly adopted patch
	from Ryan Lortie <desrt@desrt.ca> (changed from comma-separated string 
	to strlist) to add list of write speeds supported by a CD/DVD Burner.

2006-01-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add docs for volume.ignore

2006-01-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount: Respect volume.ignore and refuse to
	mount if set to TRUE

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.h: Export libhal_volume_should_ignore
	as a public method (API addition, no breakage)

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c (libhal_volume_should_ignore): New
	function.
	(libhal_volume_from_udi): Set vol->ignore_volume from property

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: Introduce volume.ignore
	as a way for vendors and admins to signify a volume should be ignored.

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-card-readers.fdi: Add an entry
	for my Firewire card reader (yes, it works perfectly on my PB 12" G4
	running Fedora Rawhide - it's fast too.. vroom vroom). 

2006-01-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c (libhal_volume_from_udi): Auch,
	volume.fsusage may be an empty string and our string extraction
	macro then yields NULL. Hence vol->fsusage is never set and just
	left as a 0 from the memset meaning _USAGE_MOUNTABLE_FILESYSTEM.
	Thus, gnome-vfs thinks the volume is mountable and displays it.
	Fix this by initializing vol->fsuage to _USAGE_UNKNOWN.

2006-01-13  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	Fixed fd.o bug #5137 with slightly adopted and split off patch

	revert my patch from 2005-08-31 and added property info.category 
	back

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/10-storage-policy.fdi: added by John (J5) 
	Palmieri proposed fix and changed match from info.category to
	info.capabilities. 

2006-01-13  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c: (usbraw_compute_udi), (video4linux_add),
	(video4linux_compute_udi), (dvb_add), (dvb_compute_udi): Add device
	objects for video and dvb devices, to have a way for applications to
	find the associated device nodes. Meaningful properties need to be
	added by someone who knows about this device class.

	* tools/device-manager/Representation.py: Add match to show icon
	in hal-device-manager.

2006-01-13  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

2006-01-11  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Don't trust any user input, replace all suspicious chars with '_'.

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: add
	volume.unmount.valid_options
	* tools/hal-system-storage-eject:
	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount:
	* tools/hal-system-storage-unmount: allow "lazy" to be passed

2006-01-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-hid-ups.c: Also add battery.reporting.*
	properties

2006-01-10  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount: Fix a potential security hole where
	the user could pass e.g. umask=`/bin/evil` and thus execute /bin/evil
	with root priviliges. Also require /bin/bash instead of just /bin/sh.
	Reported by Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>.

2006-01-08  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hal.conf.in: Add a fallback for the root user for distros that do
	not have working at_console support. Also refactor these a little to
	make updating easier, and to stop the multiple matches overhead.
	We use user="0" because some paranoid system administrators rename 
	the user for uid 0 and make a dummy user named root.

2006-01-09  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c: (libhal_drive_find_all_volumes):
	added slightly adopted patch from Chris Spiegel <l@happyjack.org> 
	to fix fd.o bug #5279 (added NULL termination of array).

2006-01-09  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* tools/lshal.c: (dump_children): removed unneeded code, (main):
	added more informative error message if connection to hald fails.

2006-01-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: Populate the new
	property volume.mount.valid_options

	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount: Don't add any options at all (we
	used to add e.g. quiet,shortname=winnt,uid=$UID for vfat and others)
	as this is now the responsibility of the client (e.g. gnome-mount).

	Use the white-list from the new property volume.mount.valid_options
	and perform special handling for the entry "uid=".

	* tools/hal-system-storage-eject: Also attempt to remove directory
	on eject

2006-01-04  Aaron Bockover  <aaron@aaronbock.net>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (hald_exec_method): move uid_export to root scope

	removing mount directory in case where mount fails

2006-01-06  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: fixed type of volume.policy.mount_option
	from string to bool as in the code/existing fdi-files.

	Add scsi_generic devices.

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c: (scsi_generic_add),
	(scsi_generic_compute_udi):

2005-12-21  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Move callout one level up.

	* tools/Makefile.am:
	* tools/callouts/hal-system-storage-cleanup-mountpoints:
	* tools/hal-system-storage-cleanup-mountpoints:

2005-12-20  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* tools/hal-system-storage-unmount:

2005-12-14  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Remove the dry-run boolean option. Need a better way to figure out
	what mount options are available.

	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount : 
	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: 

2005-12-13  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Add a boolean parameter to Mount for dry-run.

	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount : 
	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/20-storage-methods.fdi: 

2005-12-14  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Add HAL_METHOD_INVOKED_BY_UID to the method call environment 
	and use it to mount FAT, NTFS and hfs volumes to make them available
	to the user who invoked the method.
	* hald/hald_dbus.c: (hald_exec_method):
	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount:

2005-12-13  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* tools/hal-system-power-reboot,
	tools/hal-system-power-shutdown: Fixed broken scripts and changed 
	error messages.

2005-12-12  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/Makefile.am,
	  fdi/policy/10osvendor/Makefile.am,
	  fdi/preprobe/10osvendor/Makefile.am: fixed validate fdi files for
	correct XML in target check to fix broken 'make distcheck'

2005-12-12  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* tools/hal-system-power-shutdown, tools/hal-system-power-reboot,
	tools/Makefile.am: As discussed, add the Shutdown() and Reboot()
	methods so that different distros can add the particular command
	in one central place, rather than in lots of patches to other programs.

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/10-power-mgmt-policy.fdi:
	Add Shutdown() and Reboot() methods to HAL.

2005-12-12  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* tools/hal-system-storage-mount: Fix fallback to default mount
	point which failed if the volume label was not valid.

2005-12-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Artem Kachitchkine <Artem.Kachitchkin@Sun.COM>.

	* fdi/fdi.dtd: I tried to validate fdi files using fdi.dtd and got
	a whole lot of errors. Looks like DTD is out of date. This patch
	updates the DTD and adds fdi validation to 'make check'. I'm not
	an XML expert, please review carefully.

	* fdi/preprobe/10osvendor/Makefile.am,
	fdi/policy/10osvendor/Makefile.am,
	fdi/information/10freedesktop/Makefile.am: Add xmllint to the
	check target

2005-12-11  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll):  Force 'rate' to be zero
	in the case that the battery is neither charging nor discharging.
	This workaround is required for some buggy ACPI implementations.

2005-12-09  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c: (hotplug_event_begin_add_classdev): Update
	the driver property if we add a class device. A module load or manual
	driver bind did not update "info.linux.driver" of the parent device
	and NetworkManager depends on that property.

2005-12-09  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Add methods to storage objects to request:
	  Mount(string:mountpointname string:fstype stringlist:mountoptions)
	  Unmount()
	  Eject()

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/Makefile.am:

2005-12-08  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c: (hald_exec_method):
	Correct error path.

2005-12-08  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c: (hald_exec_method): Allow stringlists
	to be passed to method calls. Signature "sas" will expect:
	Method(string: array:string:abc,xyz)

2005-12-08  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Kernel 2.6.15 will have a poll()'able /proc/mounts file, which
	tells us about mount tree changes. Kernel 2.6.16 will no longer
	have any netlink event regarding block devices mount/claim.
	We watch only /proc/mounts from now, remove all netlink listening
	and depend on kernel version 2.6.15.

	With every mount event, we update all known devices now, to the
	current state found in /proc/mounts. The device name in /proc/mounts
	is ignored, but the dev_t of the underlying block device is
	looked up to find the hal device. That way, /dev/root and rootdev
	will also be recognized and the current mount state becomes visible.

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c: (blockdev_refresh_mount_state),
	(add_blockdev_probing_helper_done):
	* hald/linux2/blockdev.h:
	* hald/linux2/classdev.c:
	* hald/linux2/osspec.c: (hald_helper_data),
	(mount_tree_changed_event), (osspec_init):

2005-12-05  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c (set_suspend_hibernate_keys):
	Software Suspend 2 enabled kernels don't have "disk" in
	/sys/power/state, but still they can still hibernate.
	Some older versions have a /proc/software_suspend config directory
	but new versions switched to the /proc/suspend2 config directory.
	Add the detection for these to set the correct value for the 
	power_management.can_hibernate key.

2005-12-02  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c, hald/linux2/apm.c, hald/linux2/pmu.c:
	Now we have can_suspend and can_hibernate we should remove the
	power_management.is_enabled key as .type and .can_* convey the
	information better.

2005-12-02  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c, doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in:
	Add the new keys power_management.can_suspend and 
	power_management.can_hibernate using a new function
	set_suspend_hibernate_keys ().
	Also document these, as well as power_management.type in the 
	xml specification.

2005-12-01  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: Small patch to fix a problem with refreshing
	battery values. When the ac_adapter is removed, the 
	battery_poll_infrequently() method is called which updates last_full.
	The other states the battery may be in are also going to change at that
	instance (for example going from charged to discharging) and so we
	should be updating those too.

2005-11-29  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/10-storage-policy.fdi: changed
	mount point for dvd recorder.

2005-11-29  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/Makefile.am, hald/hald.c: (main): Added PATH to the with
	hal distributed scripts to the hald environment PATH.

	* tools/Makefile.am: moved scripts to $(datadir)/hal/scripts to
	remove them from PATH of the root user, because they should only
	be called by hald and not by a user (at least because of 
	missing environment variable , normaly set by hald)

2005-11-29  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* tools/hal-luks-remove.in, tools/hal-luks-setup.in,
	  tools/hal-system-lcd-get-brightness, 
	  tools/hal-system-lcd-set-brightness, 
	  tools/hal-system-power-set-power-save, 
	  tools/hal-system-power-suspend: Added checks for needed 
	environment variables to prevent call them from commandline if a
	variable is missing. Fixed error messages. 

2005-11-29  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* tools/device-manager/Makefile.am: removed hal-device-manager from
	 $(datadir)/hal/device-manager to prevent unneeded double install.

2005-11-29  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/util.c: (util_compute_time_remaining): added calculated 
	chargeRate to hash table and use if nothing changed between events
	to prevent remove battery.remaining_time.

2005-11-28  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-music-players.fdi:
	Add a patch from Davide Ferrari <vide80@gmail.com> which adds the
	Samsung Yepp YP-ST5. It is a portable device capable of playing
	MPEG1/2/2.5 Layer3, WMA, ASF and Ogg/Vorbis.

2005-11-21  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-card-readers.fdi: Added 
	Sony Ericsson mobile phones with Memory Stick (Pro Duo). 
	Remove unneeded multiple checks for storage.bus == usb.

2005-11-21  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.html: generated for 0.5.5.1 spec

	* tools/device-manager/Makefile.am: fix for make distcheck

2005-11-21  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* volume_id/fat.c: (volume_id_probe_vfat): fix recognition of weird
	FAT volumes.
	* volume_id/volume_id.h: Version 55

2005-11-21  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-card-readers.fdi:
	Add patch from Pozsar Balazs to match another common theme for
	USB card readers.

2005-11-15  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c: (hald_udev_data), (hald_helper_data),
	(osspec_init): Listen to socket: /org/freedesktop/hal/udev_event
	Udev will pass all data over this socket to HAL, if the following
	rule is given:
	  RUN+="socket:/org/freedesktop/hal/udev_event"

	The HAL hotplug helper /usr/sbin/hal.hotplug is no longer needed
	and should be replaced by the direct udev connection which will
	no longer fork a process for every event.

	This is the preparation to reuse the persistent data udev collects
	from the hardware, instead of querying it a second time with HAL.
	If we reach this, drive_id/* and the hotplug helper will be removed
	from HAL.

2005-11-15  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	libvolume_id: sync with udev version and prepare
	for a possible future external dependency.

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c: (advanced_disc_detect): Switch
	to glib function instead of the volume_id private ones.

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-storage.c: (strdup_valid_utf8), (main):
	Fix to prevent sending invalid UTF8 strings from storage serials to D-BUS
	which prevent adding the whole storage divice to the device store. The

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c: (acpi_get_event_fp_kernel),
	(acpi_get_event_fp_acpid), (main): fix problems with addon if acpid socket
	is not available if HAL starts. In this case retry to connect until we get 
	the socket. Also added the proc kernel eventinterface to the loop to prevent
	problems on resume from suspend. This should prevent restart the whole HAL
	if lost acpid or proc event source.

	* tools/lshal.c: (dump_devices), (usage), (main): added new option -s|--short
	for short output, changed short option for show to -u, added new status line 
	to --monitor mode, allowed combine --monitor with --long|short|tree, added 
	restrict check for incorrect command options (e.g. 'lshal --'), set --long
	as default if called lshal without option.

	Add yet another common naming theme for a generic card reader, 
	apparently with a Realtek chip. Vendor ID = 0xbda, Device ID = 0x103
	Patch from Jerome Lodewyck <lodewyck@clipper.ens.fr>, many thanks.

2005-10-31  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c (netlink_detection_data_ready): Look at all
	netlink messages, not just the first one. 
	Patch from Jon Nettleton <jon.nettleton@gmail.com>.

2005-10-26  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/hald.c: (usage), (main): added --version command line option
	to print the PACKAGE_VERSION of HAL.

2005-10-26  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c: (update_mount_point): Added, to workaround 
	kernel problem with announce mounted device in /proc/mounts before 
	send netlink event (currently reported for gentoo kernel, see: 
	http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/hal/2005-October/003634.html),
	one retry after 0.3 seconds to check /proc/mounts. 
	This is specially for voluntary preemption kernel.

2005-10-26  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/hald.c: (usage), (main); hald/hald.h : Added new command 
	line option '--use-syslog' to write debug messages to syslog 
	instead of stderr. With this option HAL writes debug messages also 
	if run as daemon. 
	Removed useless call of logger_init (). Moved first debug message 
	to reduce unneeded double check of opt_become_daemon.

	* hald/logger.c: (logger_enable_syslog), (logger_disable_syslog),
	(logger_emit); hald/logger.h: Added write to syslog instead of
	stderr. Remove empty and useless function logger_init ().

2005-10-26  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-storage.c: (main): Emit "EjectPressed" event
	for an optical drive, when it has a media inserted and the tray button is
	pressed.

2005-10-25  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (acpi_synthesize): Check if there is a battery
	bay and/or a LID button to verify if the machine is a latop. If so 
	change the key system.formfactor to 'laptop' (to workaround missing/
	unknown information from smbios).
	Fixed typo in code documentation.

	* hald/linux2/apm.c: (battery_refresh),
	(apm_synthesize_hotplug_events), (apm_generic_compute_udi): Fixed keys
	if the battery is removed. Changed check for battery and added more 
	criterions to be sure that we add only known values. Also fixed the 
	udi of APM devices, now the udi contains the name of the devicetype. 

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c: (computer_probing_pcbios_helper_done):
	Fixed creation of key system.formfactor from smbios information to be
	sure never overwrite already set key (e.g. from APM/ACPI/PMU).

2005-10-25  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/ids.c: updated list of PNP IDs and added some comments.

2005-10-24  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* volume_id/vxfs.c: (volume_id_probe_vxfs):
	* volume_id/vxfs.h: Add missing files from volume_id 52.

2005-10-24  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* configure.in: added info about libusb support for addon-usb-csr
	to display whether the addon is compiled or not.

2005-10-23  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	volume_id version 52:

	* volume_id/Makefile.am: add ocfs1 and vxfs

	* volume_id/ext.c: (volume_id_probe_ext): Check for
	valid block size, cause the signature is only 2 bytes long.
	Also detect ext3 external journals and fsversion for ext fs's.

	* volume_id/fat.c: (volume_id_probe_vfat): Detect invalid
	formatted FAT32 volumes. mkdosfs can create fs layouts which
	no sane formatting program would do.

	* volume_id/ocfs.c: (volume_id_probe_ocfs1),
	(volume_id_probe_ocfs2): Add ocfs1 and correct wrong probing
	for ocfs2.

	* volume_id/reiserfs.c: (volume_id_probe_reiserfs): Match
	fs names with the kernel module names.

	* volume_id/util.c: (volume_id_get_buffer): Use ssize to
	catch returned error.

	* volume_id/volume_id.c: (volume_id_probe_all): Probe for
	ocfs1 and vxfs.

	* volume_id/volume_id.h: Version 52.

2005-10-21  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/preprobe/10osvendor/10-ide-drives.fdi: removed no longer
	needed blacklist entry for 'HL-DT-STCD-RW/DVD-ROM GCC-4240N'.
	This work fine at least with kernel 2.6.13 (tested with SUSE).

2005-10-21  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/util.c: (callout_failed): This patch fix possible segfault if
	the callout of a non-existing addon from key info.addons fails.

2005-10-21  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* configure.in: added Hellenic translation to ALL_LINGUAS 

2005-10-15  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: Whitespace cleanups and doxygen markup
	additions. No code changes.

2005-10-11  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c: Cleanup existing code to avoid
	  reinventing the fgets() wheel.  Also deal gracefully with acpid
	  restarts (we used to exit in this case).

2005-10-10  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: Add a patch by Pascal Terjan 
	<pterjan@mandriva.com> to fix fstab parsing:
	According to fstab manpage, fields 5 and 6 are optional (and 
	treated as 0 if they are not present).
	However, if you have a fstab with one (or both) field missing and
	some whitespaces at the end of the line, fstab-sync will fail to
	parse the file.
	The patch has been in Mandrake Cooker since September, 6 with no
	ill effects.

2005-10-10  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-smbios.c: the smbios prober now works with
	the new version of dmidecode (found in latest Ubuntu and Fedora Core 
	Rawhide) that has a different output than the older format.
	I've also cleaned up the file substantially.

2005-09-28  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* tools/hal-system-power-hibernate, 
	tools/hal-system-power-set-power-save,
	tools/hal-system-power-suspend: Use sensible fallbacks as discussed:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.hal/3239

2005-09-28  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Apply patch from 
	Pierre Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx> to add documentation for the
	new mmc.* properties and the platform.* descriptions for 
	"platform bus" support.

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-serial.c: New file to probe serial ports
	to see if they actually exist. Drivers such as 8250 are considered
	legacy and very enumeration-unfriendly, and just create up to 32
	devices that don't actually exist.
	Patch from Pierre Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx>

	* hald/linux2/probing/Makefile.am: Add the probe-serial prober.

	* hald/linux2/probing/.cvsignore: Add hald-probe-serial.

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (hotplug_event_begin_add_blockdev): There was
	some debate about the interpretation of the kernel's removable
	attribute. The result is that removable means that the device stays
	but the media disappears. Because of this MMC needs to set the
	hotpluggable attribute to be handled correctly.
	Patch from Pierre Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx>

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (platform_add): New function, to add support
	to devices connected to the platform bus.
	These kind of devices are commonly, incorrectly, called legacy devices.
	Patch from Pierre Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx>

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (hotplug_event_begin_add_blockdev): 
	Properly enumerate a flopy drive connected to the platform bus.
	Patch from Pierre Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx>

2005-09-27  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* Apply patch from Martin Pitt <martin@piware.de> to fix the build on
	AMD64 by replacing kernel-style datatypes (like _u8 and __s16) with
	their appropriate standard datatype (uint8_t and int16_t).
	Also change to use <stdint.h> instead of <sys/types.h> for maximum 
	portability.

2005-09-26  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* tools/hal-system-lcd-{get|set}-brightness: use the raw values in the
	SetBrightness and GetBrightness methods, as some laptops have an odd
	number of steps that cannot be easily expressed in percent.

2005-09-20  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/pmu.c (pmu_synthesize_hotplug_events): Set the key
	system.formfactor to "laptop" if we have a battery bay.

2005-09-13  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/hal-system-power-hibernate: Actually make this script work

2005-09-12  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* tools/hal-system-power-hibernate: Add suspend2 functionality for
	mandrake, gentoo, slackware and debian, but don't add for redhat, 
	fedora, suse or altlinux as they have alternative distro tools to do
	this. I have not done this for all distros as suspend2 is not upstream
	and some users may not want to use suspend2 functionality.

2005-09-12  Ryan Lortie  <desrt@desrt.ca>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: Some more workarounds for buggy ACPI
	  implementations.  Clamp current capacity to never exceed last full
	  capacity (to prevent >100% readings).  Make sure the voltage that we
	  use to calculate current and last full capacity never exceeds design
	  voltage.  Add a check to battery_refresh to ensure design voltage is
	  not unknown (and use 1mV if it is).  Variable rename to indicate
	  that the quantities that we're dealing with are arbitrary
	  'normalised' units that might not be mWh (often µWh).

2005-09-03  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* tools/hal-system-lcd-set-brightness,
	tools/hal-system-lcd-get-brightness: New files needed for the
	SetBrightness and GetBrightness support.

	* tools/Makefile.am: Add hal-system-lcd-set-brightness and
	hal-system-lcd-get-brightness.

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/10-laptop-panel-mgmt-policy.fdi: New file, add
	the SetBrightness and GetBrightness methods to the LaptopPanel object.

	To test, use:
	dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal \
	/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/acpi_toshiba \
	org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.LaptopPanel.SetBrightness \

	dbus-send --system --print-reply --dest=org.freedesktop.Hal \
	/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/acpi_toshiba \
	org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.LaptopPanel.GetBrightness

	* hal.conf.in: Set so that org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.LaptopPanel can
	only be accessed from just the console user. This is tested to work.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (acpi_synthesize_item): New function, factor the 
	code out from acpi_synthesize.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (acpi_synthesize_hotplug_events, 
	laptop_panel_refresh): Add detection for the module toshiba, asus,
	ibm, sony and panasonic, and add the laptop_panel for these ACPI 
	extensions.

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Document laptop_panel.num_levels and 
	laptop_panel.acpi_method.

	* doc/TODO: Add the note about dbus return types for scripts.

2005-09-01  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (hald_exec_method_cb): Fix up a bug where the
	script for a method call returns garbage and we pass that to
	dbus_message_new_error which then fails.

2005-09-01  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/Makefile.am: Added 15-storage-luks.fdi to
	Makefile. 

2005-08-31  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-music-players.fdi:
	Removed merge of not useful key info.category=portable_audio_player.
	This merge breakes the storage policy and prevent mount of USB storage
	players. See bug: https://bugzilla.novell.com/show_bug.cgi?id=113966

2005-08-31  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* configure.in: Display in summery if we are building in acpid support.

2005-08-30  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: s/mediumstate/medium_state/. Yes, I'll
	learn to type someday. Patch from Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>.

2005-08-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (ccwgroup_add_lcs_properties): The
	following fix is needed to get a correct ccwgroup.lcs.portnumber
	property, since the underlying portno sysfs attribute is decimal,
	not binary. Patch from Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>.

2005-08-26  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update for release 0.5.4

2005-08-26  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* Makefile.am: Add mkinstalldirs to EXTRA_DIST for now

	* tools/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Also dist $(sbin_SCRIPTS)

2005-08-26  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* configure.in: added sl_SI to ALL_LINGUAS 

	* hald/util.c: (hal_util_helper_invoke_with_pipes),
	(callout_failed): Added Patch from Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>
	With This patch HAL skips failing callouts in the execution list 
	instead of waiting in the mainloop to be killed.

2005-08-25  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c: (set_volume_id_values):
	Fixed to prevent set a empty info.product from the patch before.

2005-08-25  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/probing/Makefile.am: Added glib to Makefile.
	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c: (strdup_valid_utf8),
	(set_volume_id_values): Fix to prevent sending invalid UTF8 
	strings from volumelabels to D-BUS. The invalid, non UTF8, 
	characters replaced now with '?'. 

2005-08-25  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* configure.in: Added Polish po file.

2005-08-24  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (battery_refresh): Little string fix from
	"Unknown ACPI Unit" to "unknown" for simpler checks.

2005-08-24  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-pda.fdi: Updated fdi file
	for Sony Clie SJ-22, Palm m130, Palm Tungsten T5 and Handspring
	Visor. Removed merge of info.product to serial device for Palm 
	devices since the strings from the device are more informatively.

2005-08-23  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Fix sloppy error handling in volume_id.

	* volume_id/util.c: (volume_id_get_buffer):
	* volume_id/volume_id.c: (volume_id_probe_all):
	* volume_id/volume_id.h:

2005-08-23  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>  

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Updated spec for new keys from the
	VCD/SVCD/VideoDVD patch.

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c: (advanced_disc_detect),
	(main): Added revised patch from Kevin Ottens <ervin@kde.org> to
	detect VCD/SVCD/VideoDVD.

2005-08-23  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-input.c (main): Proper debug output
	for input class probe helper. Patch from Pierre Ossman
	<drzeus@drzeus.cx>.

2005-08-23  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal/Makefile.am, configure.in: Since gcc 3.4.4, 4.0.1 and
	4.1.0, some gcov symbols have been declared hidden, resulting in a
	link error when trying to link hald-probe-*. The problem is that
	libhal.so hasn't been linked with libgcov. Patch from Cornelia
	Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>.

2005-08-23  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: Added Basque (eu) to ALL_LINGUAS

2005-08-23  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-input.c: (check_abs): Fixed detection of
	input capability for joysticks (input.joystick).

2005-08-23  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* configure.in: Added Korean translation file to configure.

2005-08-22  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com> to change timeout from
	25 seconds to 250 seconds as a temporary workaround.

	* hald/hald.c (parent_wait_for_child): I'm running into some
	problems when trying to start the HAL daemon on large
	installations (like a S/390 LPAR with several thousands of
	devices). Device detection may take quite some time, more than the
	25 seconds specified as a timeout value for select() in
	hald/hald.c, and as a result, the daemon will abort.	

2005-08-22  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh, battery_refresh_poll): 
	Fix up the typos where we were not setting battery.charge_level.unit.
	Also fix the segfault reported by Martin Pitt where HAL would segfault
	where reporting_unit was NULL. I've protected the strcmp, and have
	changed the code to assume mWh so that the users of these BIOS's get
	some values set.
	I've changed battery_refresh_poll to use this scheme too, as users of
	broken BIOS's would currently get no updates (as it was handled with 
	"goto out") and with this they will.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll): Fix the bug reported by 
	Paolo Borelli [http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=314182]
	by checking the battery.voltage.current, and if not valid, using
	battery.voltage.design, and if that's not valid, using 1 as a fallback.
	

2005-08-22  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/util.c (util_compute_time_remaining, 
	util_compute_percentage_charge): Add some more checks for broken BIOS's
	and add some more comments.

2005-08-22  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c: (net_add): Fix for more informative 
	info.product names for WLAN to differ between LAN and WLAN interfaces.

2005-08-22  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-pda.fdi: Added for all Palm 
	PDAs, not handled by special matches, also port 0 as hotsync port to be 
	sure that there is at least one correct port.

2005-08-21  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	As of Linux 2.6.14, the kernel will export a mmc_host class for
	MMC- devices. This patch teaches hal about this. Patch from Pierre
	Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx>.

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c (mmc_host_add): New function
	(mmc_host_compute_udi): New function

2005-08-21  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* packaging/suse/hal.spec: Added rpm spec-file for SUSE/openSUSE.

2005-08-21  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/util.c: (util_compute_percentage_charge): Fix to return 100 for 
	computed percentage values > 100% instead of -1. This can happen on
	ACPI systems wich reports temporarily a higher 'remaining capacity' 
	then the 'last full capacity'.

2005-08-20  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* configure.in: Fix to get all current available translations.

2005-08-19  Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll): Remove checks for negative
	times and percentages.
	Also remove key if invalid data is returned.

	* hald/util.c (util_compute_time_remaining, 
	util_compute_percentage_charge): Add checks for negative times and 
	percentages - this lets up remove lots of checks for each subsystem.
	The keys will only be populated when the data is valid, as discussed:
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.hal/2944

	* hald/linux2/apm.c (battery_refresh): Add calculation of 
	the key "battery.charge_level.percentage" so that it matches acpi.
	Also remove key if invalid data is returned.

	* hald/linux2/pmu.c (battery_refresh): Make the calculation and logic of
	remaining_percentage and remaining_time match that of acpi and apm.
	Also remove key if invalid data is returned.

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add description of the key
	battery.charge_level.percentage and explain why it's sometimes missing.
	Also modified description of battery.remaining_time explaining the
	different meanings while charging and discharging.

2005-08-19  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* tools/hal-system-power-hibernate, 
	  tools/hal-system-power-set-power-save, 
	  tools/hal-system-power-suspend: Add dectection of ALTLinux, SUSE, 
	Mandrake, Slackware, Debian and Gentoo and add support for powersave 
	for SUSE and ALTLinux (powersave will be included to next release ALT 
	Linux 3.0) to the scripts.

2005-08-18  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-music-players.fdi: From my
	point of view all of these devices should have the capability
	'portable_audio_player'. Those who are a disk drive with the extra
	feature of playing stuff should probably keep 'storage' as
	category. The rest should have 'portable_audio_player'. Patch from
	Pierre Ossman <drzeus-list@drzeus.cx>.

2005-08-18  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-music-players.fdi: Add

2005-08-18  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-pda.fdi: fixed merge
	pda.*.hotsync_interface to copy correct property ('serial.device'
	instead of nonexistent 'serial_device')

2005-08-16  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	First stab at system power management... Need to put this in the
	hal spec too..

	* hal.conf.in: Add security policy for Device.SystemPowerManagement
	and Device.Volume.Crypto interfaces - only allow the console user to
	invoke methods on these interfaces

	* fdi/policy/10osvendor/10-power-mgmt-policy.fdi: Add methods
	Suspend(int secondsBeforeWakeup), Hibernate() and
	SetPowerSave(bool shouldSavePower) to the
	org.freedesktop.Hal.Device.SystemPowerManagement interface

	* tools/Makefile.am (sbin_SCRIPTS): Add hal-system-power-*

2005-08-11  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c, hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c
	hald/linux2/addons/addon-pmu.c, hald/linux2/addons/addon-storage.c,
	hald/linux2/pmu.c: (battery_refresh): Fixed several compiler warnings 
	and removed unused variables.

2005-08-11  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (battery_refresh_poll): Fixed several battery keys 
	to be sure that hal not provides battery key with not up-to-date values,
	if the battery is full charged. Now we set all values which are in  
	/proc/acpi/battery/*/{info,state} already 'unknown' (e.g. 'present rate')
	to 0.

2005-08-11  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (battery_refresh_poll): Check now if computed 
	remaining percentage and remaining time values are valid. Now we only 
	add positive values.

	* hald/util.c: (util_compute_percentage_charge),
	(util_compute_time_remaining): Return -1 instead of 0 if an error occurs 
	to differentiate between an error and an empty battery. Return now -1 if 
	parameter chargeRate, chargeLevel or chargeLastFull are negative. Removed
	unneeded warning.

2005-08-11  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (battery_refresh): remove also 
	battery.charge_level.rate, battery.reporting.unit and 
	battery.remaining_time if the battery is removed. 

2005-08-11  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (battery_refresh_poll): Normalise 
	battery.reporting.last_full with voltage_current instead of 
	voltage_design because battery.charge_level.last_full is a changing and 
	not a static value like voltage_design, which is a "marketing assurance".  

2005-08-11  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (acpi_poll_battery), (acpi_poll_acadap), 
	(acpi_poll): Splitted acpi_poll() into acpi_poll_battery() and 
	acpi_poll_acadapt(). 
	(battery_refresh):battery.present is now read 
	from /proc/acpi/battery/*/state instead of reading the information 
	from /proc/acpi/battery/*/info since reading from the info proc entry 
	takes very long on several systems. If a ACPI battery event occurs, 
	we now also gather the information for ac_adapter.present. This helps 
	to detect the AC online/offline state for machine which do not trigger 
	an ACPI event for AC online/offline but still report battery events 
	by an issuing ACPI event.
	(ac_adapter_refresh_poll), (battery_refresh_poll), 
	(battery_poll_infrequently), (ac_adapter_refresh), 
	(acpi_synthesize_hotplug_events): Status for battery.reporting.last_full 
	is now read by battery_poll_infrequently ().  This saves several 
	open/read calls to /proc/acpi/battery/*/{info,state} and enables 
	reuse of the information gathered (makes reopening of the {info,state} 
	proc entries unnecessary). battery_poll_infrequently () is invoked:
	every 60 minutes and once a AC adapter ACPI event occurs. This prevents
	open/read calls to /proc/acpi/battery/*/info more often then intended.

2005-08-10  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c (libhal_volume_from_udi): Actually
	export the right volume.fsusage

2005-08-10  Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c: (blockdev_compute_udi): fix compute of 
	volume_label_* UDIs.

2005-08-09  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (ccw_add_tape_properties):
	tape.ccw.mediumstate should be ccw.tape.mediumstate, fix the typo.
	Patch from Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>.

2005-08-06  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* configure.in:
	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c: (main):
	Make the possible ACPI event sources configurable, cause binding
	the exclusive kernel socket instead of the proposed acpid socket
	may cause trouble.

2005-08-05  Danny Kukawka  <danny.kukawka@web.de>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Added new namespace for OSS devices
	and updated ALSA namespace for new devices.

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c, hald/linux2/classdev.h (sound_add), 
	(sound_compute_udi): Added OSS devices and ALSA/OSS global devices. 
	OSS devices are only added if the kernel supports device links to the 
	related physical device. Adapted sound_compute_udi() to generate
	UDIs for the new devices. For the required kernel patch (going  
	upstream soon) see: 
	http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.freedesktop.hal/2862

2005-08-02  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (acpi_poll): Fix a memory leak here

2005-08-02  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Richard Hughes <hughsient@gmail.com>.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (ac_adapter_refresh_poll): New function, just
	set the present key. This is quicker than setting the capability
	and category on every forced refresh.
	(ac_adapter_refresh): Use ac_adapter_refresh_poll and while we are
	here, add device_property_atomic_update_begin and
	device_property_atomic_update_end to make atomic.
	(acpi_poll): Add the ac_adapter updates to make sure we get the
	value of ac_adapter correct at least on every 30 second forced
	refresh. This fixes really broken ACPI BIOS's that don't emit acad
	or batt events.

2005-08-01  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (acpi_poll): Only poll if the battery is actually
	present. Patch from Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>.
	(battery_refresh_poll): Be a little bit more
	careful and don't segfault if battery.reporting_unit doesn't exist

2005-08-01  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>.

	* libhal/libhal.c, hald/linux2/ids.c: This is a patch to fix usage
	of #NULL within the doxygen code documentation (replaced through 
	'NULL' since '#NULL' generates a warning).

2005-08-01  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Richard Hughes <hughsient@gmail.com>. Reported by Ryan
	Lortie <desrt@desrt.ca>.
	
	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll, battery_refresh):
	convert the current values from mAh to mWh (some laptops report in
	other than mWh) by multiplying by the current voltage. This gives
	us "energy" units that are not dependent on the current voltage of
	the battery. This fixes the
	bug (http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=309944) where the
	remaining time was being worked out with incorrect logic. The
	util_compute_time_remaining and util_compute_percentage_charge
	functions now take the sanitised values too. This patch introduces
	the new keys battery.reporting.* representing the raw values from
	ACPI. This will not change API for existing programs (as the old
	charge_level keys are just re-used for the sanitised values). A
	battery.charge_level.design key of "Unknown ACPI Unit" represents
	an unknown unit that may have to be calculated like mAh.

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Update spec with new keys

2005-07-31  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/device_store.c (hal_device_store_add): this is a patch to
	prevent adding a device with invalid UDI (doesn't start with
	"/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/") to the 'global device
	list'. Without this patch it's possible to add a device with
	invalid UDI. If so, you can't see the device e.g. via lshal and
	get always a dbus error. Original patch from Danny Kukawka
	<danny.kukawka@web.de>; slightly tweaked.

2005-07-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-hid-ups.c: This one for UPS's (which
	are always measured in percent, so no division needed). I think
	that's all of the capability battery devices now. All I have to do
	is wait for the next release of HAL, and i can depend on that new
	version (but I'm guessing it'll be a long wait :-). Patch from
	Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>.

2005-07-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	The FSF moved to a new address, so I updated all license headers
	and the COPYING file. Patch from Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>.

2005-07-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>.

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-usb-csr.c: Change default polling to 30
	seconds as mice discharge *very* slowly and do not need to be polled
	once every 10 seconds.
	Add to addon-usb-csr the key battery.charge_level.percentage so we can
	provide a better interface to programs that use this data.
	Also reformat this file so that it matches the rest of the HAL source
	in style, and get rid of the spaces-for-tabs.

2005-07-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>.

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c,
	tools/device-manager/hal-device-manager.glade, tools/fstab-sync.c:
	this is a patch to fix typos of translatable strings. New
	translation files will follow due to end of August.
	
2005-07-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>
	
	Patch from Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>.

	* hald/linux2/pmu.c (battery_refresh): Call
	util_compute_percentage_charge so we can populate
	battery.charge_level.percentage.

2005-07-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com>.
	
	* hald/util.c (util_compute_percentage_charge): New function used
	to calculate the percentage charge, initially for ACPI batteries,
	but could be used by all devices as contains lots of error checks.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll): Call
	util_compute_percentage_charge so we can populate
	battery.charge_level.percentage

2005-07-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c: This is a patch to compute 'nicer' UDIs,
	/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/volume_empty_%disc.type, for emtpy
	CD/DVD volumes/discs. Patch from Danny Kukawka
	<danny.kukawka@web.de>.

2005-07-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/hal-luks-remove.in: Unmount the cleartext volume, if mounted,
	before tearing down the dm-crypt mapping

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (hotplug_event_begin_remove_blockdev):
	Actually read the is_partition from the device since e.g.
	/sys/block/dm-0 probably is a partition

2005-07-26  W. Michael Petullo  <mike@flyn.org>

	* tools/hal_set_property.c: Add --strlist-pre, --strlist-post
	and --strlist-rem options to hal-set-property

	* tools/hal-luks-setup.in: Use --strlist-pre to add hal-luks-remove to
	a LUKS device's info.callouts.remove.

2005-07-22  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c (main): hal sets
	volume.disc.is_rewriteable for DVD+R and DVD+R DL
	wrong (TRUE). This patch (against CVS) fix this to
	volume.disc.is_rewriteable=FALSE for DVD+R/DVD+R DL. Patch from

2005-07-21  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>
	
	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in, hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh):
	Here is a patch for additional information about ACPI Batteries. I
	added the following new keys:

	battery.charge_level.capacity_state (poll)

	* tools/device-manager/DeviceManager.py: Here is a patch to fix up

	<johnp@redhat.com>.

2005-07-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* NEWS: Update for release 0.5.3

2005-07-12  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/Makefile.am: Disable our regression test for now since it's
	busted and we want 'make distcheck' to pass for the new release.

2005-07-12  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal/libhal.c (libhal_ctx_init): Make init fail if hald is
	actually not running

2005-07-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll): When the battery is
	degrading a bit, and the last full battery info value is updated
	by ACPI, the new value is not reflected in HAL database. Reported
	by Paul Ionescu (i_p_a_u_l@yahoo.com); fix by Richard
	Hughes (richard@hughsie.com) (RH #162215).

2005-07-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (hotplug_event_begin_add_blockdev): Cards
	on the MMC bus got an incorrect storage.drive_type. Patch from
	Pierre Ossman <drzeus@drzeus.cx>.

2005-07-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Make it possible to create and remove HAL devices without kernel and
	sysfs support. Some legacy devices or userspace driven devices may be
	useful in HAL too, but need to be maintained by an application instead
	of the kernel itself. Patch from Steffen Winterfeldt <snwint@suse.de>.

	* tools/hal-device.c: New file

	* tools/Makefile.am: Add build rules for hal-device

	* libhal/libhal.[ch]: Remove the _agent prefix from the agent_manager 
	functions

	* hald/hald_dbus.h: Add prototypes for new functions

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (manager_new_device)
	(manager_remove_done, manager_remove)

	(manager_commit_preprobing_done)
	(manager_commit_to_gdl): New functions
	(hald_dbus_filter_handle_methods): Add handlers for new D-BUS methods

2005-07-07  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* tools/device-manager/DeviceManager.py:
	h-d-m raises:
		Traceback (most recent call last):
		File "/usr/share/hal/device-manager/DeviceManager.py", line 182, in
		DBusException: Trying to remove unkown rule:
		type='signal',interface='org.freedesktop.Hal.Device',sender=':1.1'...

	just make it useable again until we found the real reason.

2005-07-07  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c: (raise_error), (raise_no_such_device),
	(raise_no_such_property), (raise_property_type_error),
	(raise_syntax), (raise_device_not_locked),
	(raise_device_already_locked), (raise_permission_denied),
	(foreach_device_get_udi), (device_send_signal_condition),
	(local_server_message_handler):
	Unify the error handling into one common function.
	Thanks to Steffen Winterfeldt <snwint@suse.de>.

2005-07-07  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/coldplug.c: (hal_util_get_udevinfo_path),
	(hal_util_init_sysfs_to_dev_map), (coldplug_get_device_file),
	(coldplug_synthesize_events), (coldplug_synthesize_block_event),
	(coldplug_compute_visit_device):
	The next udev version will not store anything in its database if not
	neccessary. So udev does not need to write 600 pretty useless database
	files and HAL does not need to process the information that is already
	contained in the sysfs-path.

	The udevinfo-dump of the next udev version will only print devices which
	have a custom configuration. This changes HAL to look for the default
	device-node derived from the kernels devpath if udev has not specified
	anything else.

	drive->bus to LIBHAL_DRIVE_BUS_CCW if appropriate
	(libhal_volume_from_udi): Fix a bug: it's dvd_plus_[r|rw] not
	dvd_plus[r|rw]. Add support for dvd_plus_r_dl.

2005-06-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch-set from Cornelia Huck <cohuck@de.ibm.com>. I've been
	working on support for Linux on S/390 specific devices in HAL. The
	following patchset includes some non-s390 specific patches and
	support for the S/390 bus types.

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Document the properties of ccw,
	ccwgroup, iucv, and tape devices.

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c (tape_add, tape_compute_udi): This
	comprises support for both the generic tape class and the tape390
	class, as the two don't differ in anything but name.

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (hotplug_event_begin_add_blockdev): ccw
	devices need to be considered for block devices.

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (iucv_add_netiucv_properties)
	(iucv_add, iucv_compute_udi): The iucv bus is for virtual devices
	under z/VM - currently only netiucv is implemented.

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (ccwgroup_add_qeth_properties)
	(ccwgroup_add_ctc_properties, ccwgroup_add_lcs_properties)
	(ccwgroup_add_claw_properties, ccwgroup_add)
	(ccwgroup_compute_udi): The ccwgroup on S/390 contains devices
	consisting of grouped ccw devices - usually networking devices. As
	with the ccw bus, there are some common properties and lots of
	device specific ones.

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (ccw_add_dasd_properties)
	(ccw_add_zfcp_properties, ccw_add_tape_properties)
	(ccw_add_3270_properties, ccw_add, ccw_compute_udi): The ccw bus
	on s390 contains all classic channel-attached devices. They all
	have a few common properties, but also driver-specific ones.

	* hald/linux2/osspec_linux.h: Export hal_util_get_driver_name ()

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c (hal_util_get_driver_name): New function
	(hal_util_set_driver): Refactor to use hal_util_get_driver_name

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c (net_add): Set MAC-address to zero's
	if we can't read it.
	(net_compute_udi): Use some other unique ID if MAC address is
	missing or set to all zero's.

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (blockdev_compute_udi): Generate a
	sensible name for block devices for which the model is an
	empty string.

	* hald/util.c: This patch adds a needed include for some
	interfaces, or gcc 4.0 will make incorrect assumptions on the
	format of some functions.

2005-06-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* volume_id/util.h: Include stdint.h to get uint8_t and friends so
	we compile on Linux.

2005-06-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* configure.in, volume_id/*.c: This patch check for some internal
	Linux kernel types and redefine it using the standard system
	types. It also removes the a private Linux kernel include. Patch
	from Alvaro Lopez Ortega <alvaro@sun.com>.

2005-06-27  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Alvaro Lopez Ortega <alvaro@sun.com>.

	sync as it reduces performance and makes people believe that
	it wears out their drives (RH bug #157674)

2005-05-20  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-storage.c (main): Here is a fix for
	the dvdram entry in hal (0.4.x and 0.5.x).  Currently the correct
	default key (storage.cdrom.dvdram = false) is created but if the
	device can write dvdram, hal add a new key named "storage.dvdram". 
	Patch from Danny Kukawka <danny.kukawka@web.de>.

2005-05-16  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c (main): Whilst using CVS, I've

2005-04-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Make all hal helpers use a direct connection to hald rather than
	going through the bus. This is for both performance and security
	reasons. Also, fix the reconnect issue and don't connect to the
	system message bus before probing is done.

	* configure.in: Require dbus 0.33; that, for now, means D-BUS CVS
	HEAD since it requires the patch in fd.o bug #2889 and D-BUS made
	a post-release version bump. I'll look into doing a D-BUS release
	soon.

	* libhal/libhal.h: Export prototype for libhal_ctx_init_direct()

	(hald_dbus_filter_handle_methods): New function
	(hald_dbus_filter_function): Move bulk of functionality to the new
	hald_dbus_filter_handle_methods() and pass local_interface==FALSE.
	Handle Disconnect from local libdbus properly and attempt to
	reconnect to the system message bus every so often (every 3 secs)
	(local_server_message_handler): New function
	(local_server_unregister_handler): New function
	(local_server_handle_connection): New function
	(hald_dbus_local_server_addr): New function
	(hald_dbus_local_server_init): New function

	connection to the system bus as startup
	(osspec_probe_done): Only connect to the system bus once probing
	is done

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-hid-ups.c (main): Use direct connection

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c (main): Use direct connection

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-pc-floppy.c (main): Remove all references
	to hal and dbus since this program just returns the result in the
	exit code

2005-04-06  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c: (main): read volume label
	from last session of optical multisession disk.

2005-04-04  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/addons/Makefile.am (libexec_PROGRAMS): Only build
	hald-addon-usb-csr if we have libusb

	* configure.in: Check for libusb (since it appear not to build
	on s390/s390x if we don't have it)

2005-04-04  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-storage.c (main): storage.serial and
	storage.firmware_revision may return bogus data so don't quit
	if we fail when setting it (Red Hat bug #151762)

2005-04-04  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-wireless-mice.fdi: Change 
	battery.type from 'keyboard_mouse' to just 'keyboard'.

2005-04-04  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	not available. From Steve Grubb <sgrubb@redhat.com>.

2005-04-04  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>
	
	* po/zh_TW.po: New file from chaoweilun@pcmail.com.tw

	* po/ChangeLog: Updated

	* configure.in: Added zh_TW to ALL_LINGUAS

2005-04-02  Richard hughes  <richard@hughsie.com>
	
	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-usb-csr: Fix a problem where
	the capability was being added before the charge_level key
	way set, causing programs watching for the "new capability"
	to not be able to query the key until it was restarted.

2005-03-30  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-pda.fdi: Match for info.
	capabilities instead of info.bus

2005-03-30  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-pda.fdi: Update from
	Andrei Yurkevich <urruru@ru.ru>; slightly tweaked by me

2005-03-29  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* fdi/information/10freedesktop/10-usb-pda.fdi: New file to
	match all PDA's - right now it only got a single entry

2005-03-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal/libhal.c (filter_func): Stupid bug; checked for ctx->
	device_new_capability, but should check for ctx->device_condition

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (pci_add): Even more stupid bug; somehow
	the hal_util_set_driver were enclosed in an if statement, thus
	rendering the next statement conditional (the one that sets
	pci.product_id)

2005-03-23  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Sergey Udaltsov <sergey.udaltsov@gmail.com>, slightly
	tweaked to be in line with the spec

	e.g. put it in info.linux.driver

2005-03-22  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-storage.c (main): Add some extra debugging
	to help me with RH bug #151762

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c: Set <bustype>.linux.driver for all bus devices

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c (net_add): Don't set net.linux.driver, first
	of all because it doesn't make sense (drivers don't bind to class
	devices, they bind to physical devices), second because the Linux
	kernel moved around where the driver symlink is.

2005-03-21  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* doc/TODO: Add a small item here

2005-03-20  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Teach hal about Firewire devices; tested with both my iPod and
	my Powerbook in Target Disk Mode

	* tools/device-manager/Const.py.in: Collapse ieee1394_host
	and ieee1394_node into ieee1394

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (ieee1394_add): New function

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-hid-ups.c:
	Fix a typo, s/battery.is_charging/battery.rechargeable.is_charging
	so that matches ACPI (and HAL spec).

2005-03-17  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: We need to look for the
	sysfs_mount_path only if we read the ifindex from a network
	interface. This safes us from parsing the proc file with every
	hotplug event. From Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>.

2005-03-16  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Replace boolean action type of hotplug event with enum, cause
	hotplug actions are not limited to "add" and "remove" events. The
	kernel already emits "online", "offline" hotplug events for
	hotplugging cpu's.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c: (acpi_synthesize),

2005-03-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/util.c (hal_util_get_string_from_file): Yikes, variable i
	needs to be a gint rather than an guint otherwise our for-loop
	with i >= 0 will continue with i < 0 (only seen on x86_64 with
	gcc4)

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c (serial_add): Also make an unsigned int

2005-03-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Center x86_64 box

2005-03-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* doc/TODO (CVSID): Add a few items

2005-03-15  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Two patches from Kay Sievers Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux2/physdev.c (usb_add): Such events should not happen, 
	but better recover from it. :) SEQNUM=0 ACTION=add DEVPATH=
	"/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:1d.7" /usr/libexec/hal.hotplug usb

	* hald/linux2/hotplug.c (hotplug_event_begin_sysfs): While playing
	around with hotplug event replay from initramfs, it happens, that
	events are generated for devices HAL already knows from its
	coldplug run. This leads to a lot of funny double entries in the
	device store. :) We should prevent the device addition by hotplug
	events if we already have one with the same sysfs-devpath.

2005-03-12  W. Michael Petullo  <mike@flyn.org>

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c: s/sesame/luks.

	* hald/linux2/coldplug.c: Ensure that device mapper devices are
	processed after all other block devices.

2005-03-13  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/linux/add_selinux.c (main): Check if selinux is enabled,
	cause we still get the removable context on kernels where SELinux
	is disabled

2005-03-12  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/hal_get_property.c (main): Make this work for strlists

2005-03-12  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Bah, I still need to update the spec for all the new stuff; until
	then, here's some other new stuff - one very relevant use for this
	is that we can key off whether a system can ACPI S3 by e.g. looking
	at the new smbios.* properties on computer (so distros can maintain
	a whitelist) - another interesting one is system.formfactor that
	e.g. Nautilus can use to select the right icon for Computer

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-smbios.c: New file; invoke dmidecode
	and extract useful properties

	* hald/linux2/probing/Makefile.am: Add build rules for new prober
	hald-probe-smbios

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c (computer_probing_helper_done): New function
	(computer_probing_pcbios_helper_done): New function
	(osspec_probe): Do the hald-probe-smbios if system supports ACPI or
	APM; add note to do something similar for PowerMac's etc.

2005-03-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/probing/probe-volume.c (main): Patch from Kay
	Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org> I need the following to make linux
	raid volumes working again. I have a test disk here, that does not
	work with the new HAL.

2005-03-11  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Add all the ATA raid signatures which are supported in the dmraid
	library. volume_id will just recognize the raid signatures and set
	the usage to raid, to prevent raid members to show up as mountable
	volumes. Any detailed informatiuon about the raid set must be
	queried with the original lib.

	* volume_id/Makefile.am:

	* volume_id/highpoint.c: (volume_id_probe_highpoint_37x_raid),
	(volume_id_probe_highpoint_45x_raid):

	* volume_id/highpoint.h:

	* volume_id/volume_id.h: Version 42.

2005-03-11  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* volume_id/Makefile.am: add minix probing code

	* volume_id/luks.c: 

	* volume_id/minix.c: New file.

	* volume_id/minix.h: New file.

	* volume_id/util.c: (volume_id_set_unicode16),
	(volume_id_set_label_unicode16): Export unicode converter.

	* volume_id/util.h: Export unicode converter.

	* volume_id/volume_id.c: (volume_id_probe_all): Add minix.

	* volume_id/volume_id.h: Version 41.

2005-03-10  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (battery_refresh_poll): Also set property
	battery.charge_level.rate
	(acpi_poll): Make the update atomic
	
	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Update for battery.charge_level.rate

2005-03-10  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Bah, so it turns out that crappy BIOS'es and what-have-you gets really
	upset of hald, every five seconds, accessing the state file three
	times and the info file one time (in /proc/acpi/battery/BAT%d)

	https://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2005-March/msg00704.html

	So, off to read the battstat applet source - fix this up so we
	only access a single file every 30 seconds; just like battstat applet.

	I really hate hardware.

	* hald/linux2/acpi.c (ACPI_POLL_INTERVAL): Only poll every 30 seconds
	(battery_refresh_poll): New function
	(battery_refresh): Call battery_refresh_poll

	is cached for reuse

2005-03-09  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-acpi.c (main): Handle /proc/acpi/event
	as a file, not a socket. Now we can run without acpid :-). Reported
	by Bill Nottingham.

	Release 0.5.0

	* NEWS: Update for release

	optimize hald/util.c:hal_util_grep_file before we can change this -
	see the TODO in that function
	(battery_refresh): Use the hal_util_grep_discard_existing_data() since
	we are passing reuse=TRUE. Minimize amount of reads.

	purge "reused" data

	which gives us a net saving of approx 4.5MB. Sweet. (yes, this
	ChangeLog is somewhat a weblog for me these days)

	Simons <sjoerd@luon.net> : The FDI rule that detects USB ZIP drive
	and names the mountpoint is incorrectly write, so partitioned
	ZIP's are named generically. The attached patch fixes the
	test (lookup in the parent of the partition).

	* libhal/libhal.c (filter_func): Fix up condition handling now that

2005-02-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/hald.c (parent_wait_for_child): Fixup accidental message being
	printed

2005-02-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Finally got around to implementing the bit that made the parent wait
	for device probing when daemonizing. Hope that it's right this time
	cause the last time it resulted in breaking peoples pkg updates :-):

	logic as outlined in fdi/README

2005-02-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/Makefile.am: Don't install the 50-fstab-sync.hal symlink
	as we do callouts in a different way now!

	* hald/haldaemon.in: Until privilege separation is complete, run
	with --retain-privileges. Also export LIBEXECDIR as our addons
	and probers will be installed there

2005-02-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Fix a few things to get 'make distcheck' to succeed.

2005-02-22  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux2/osspec.c: Use kernel events layer instead of D_NOTIFY
	on /etc/mtab. Yay!

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c (update_mount_point): Use /proc/mounts as
	we're now using the kernel events layer to get mount/umount signals
	rather than waiting for /etc/mtab to be changed. Otherwise we've
	would have a race with mount(1). Add some usable debug information.

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (device_send_signal_property_modified): Yikes,
	append to the right iterator; fixes segfault

2005-02-22  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal/libhal.c: Patch from John (J5) Palmieri
	<johnp@redhat.com>. Most libhal methods now require an additional
	DBusError pointer to be passed into the method.  Sometimes errors
	are expected in a world where device can be added or removed at
	any moment.  These errors can be handled based on the return value
	of the method and do not need the extra verbosity that the dbus
	errors provide.  Attached is a patch which allows a NULL value to
	be passed to all methods which read HAL keys indicating that a
	dbus error is not needed thereby freeing the programmer from
	having to initialize and free dbus error objects when they are not
	needed.

2005-02-16  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from W. Michael Petullo <mike@flyn.org>. Attached you should
	find a patch that begins to add LUKS support to hald. This should
	eventually provide an easy means to mount encrypted filesystems.

	is built before anything else.

2005-02-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	With this path, all storage devices should be working just as
	well as on the 0.4.x branch. 

	In fact, since we're doing things in separate processes hald now
	nicely handles my very troublesome USB 6in1 card reader. There's
	other improvements too; we handle media with non-partitioned file
	systems _a lot nicer_, especially those on PCMCIA card
	readers (driven by ide-cs) since we now have logic to discard
	hotplug rem/add for those partitions.

	Rock on.

	* libhal/libhal.h: Add prototypes for libhal_device_rescan()
	and libhal_device_reprobe()

	* libhal/libhal.c (libhal_device_rescan): New function

	Rescan() of a storage device. Check for fs on main block device or
	a disc in the optical drive. Return code 2 if that is the case.

	* hald/linux2/addons/addon-storage.c (force_unmount): New function
	(unmount_childs): New function
	(is_mounted): New function
	(main): Do lazy unmount, if necessary, when media goes away. Handle
	polling on optical drives.

	* hald/linux2/hotplug.h: Add prototype for hotplug_event_reposted()
	and hotplug_event_enqueue_at_front().

	* hald/linux2/hotplug.c (hotplug_event_reposted): New function;
	like event_end but without deleting the hotplug event (useful
	for reordering events)
	(hotplug_event_enqueue_at_front): New function; to insert events
	at the front of the queue

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c:
	(generate_fakevolume_hotplug_event_add_for_storage_device): New
	function (and what a nice long name :-/)

	Add some more debug spewage when things fail.
	(force_unmount): New function
	(hotplug_event_begin_remove_blockdev): Handle fakevolume remove
	events; reorder queue to process non-handled volume before
	the storage device. Nice.
	(block_rescan_storage_done): New function
	(blockdev_rescan_device): Actually do something here; a Rescan()
	method call on a storage device will induce searching a filesystem
	on the main block device

	* hald/hald.c (main): Add new master_slave code but comment it out
	for now

	* fdi/20freedesktop/lexar-media-cf-reader.fdi: Fix up

	* fdi/20freedesktop/6in1-card-reader.fdi: Fix up to use new way
	of figuring vendor_id/product_id etc.

2005-02-10  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* configure.in: From Richard Hughes <richard@hughsie.com> I've
	also attached a patch that adds libexec to configure.in

2005-02-10  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* volume_id/fat.c (volume_id_probe_vfat): Must have been a typo by Kay,
	changed from VOLUME_ID_DISKLABEL to VOLUME_ID_FILESYSTEM.

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (remove_udi): Remember to init the DBusError since

	if appropriate

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.h: Add some new prototype for interacting
	with hotplug.c (much like what physdev.h and classdev.h)
	exported. Also add the prototype for a new function
	blockdev_mtab_changed.

	* hald/linux2/blockdev.c: Actually put some code here (the previous
	code was just boiler plate).

	* hald/util.h (struct HalHelperData_s): Add boolean already_issued_
	callback

	* hald/util.c (hal_util_get_string_from_file): Truncate whitespace
	from string read
	(hal_util_terminate_helper): Don't remove the child watcher source,
	but set a flag that we already did the callback and helper_child_exited
	will reap the child (including removing sources). This helps reap the
	zombies I've been seeing.
	(helper_child_timeout): -do-
	(helper_child_exited): Only do callback if we haven't already done
	so.

	* hald/debug-hald.sh: Another nice script for running gdb on hald;

2005-02-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>. 
	
	Since i seem to be in an extreme mood anyway, attached it is a
	patch that will make hal always drop permissions to non-root. Also
	it removes keeping the net admin capability as it's not being used
	anymore.

	I think it's the right way to do things. There should be no reason
	to run hald as root ever and forcing it from the start of the
	development cycle is a good way of ensuring that :)

	It would also be nice to have the addons that need to start out as
	root (like the ups one) drop permission as soon as possible (one
	can never be too sure)... Probably a utility function would be
	nice for that, but i don't know where to place it (as the addons
	and probers live in different dirs)

	Slightly mangled by myself to remove libcap dep and introduce
	the --retain-privileges option.

	* configure.in: Don't require libcap

	* hald/Makefile.am (hald_LDADD): Don't link with libcap

	* hald/run-hald.sh: Use new --retain-privileges option since this

	and group. Don't use libcap anymore.
	(main): Enforce new --retain-privileges option since it's useful for
	development

2005-02-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	import dbus

	bus = dbus.Bus (dbus.Bus.TYPE_SYSTEM)
	hal_service = bus.get_service ('org.freedesktop.Hal')
	d = hal_service.get_object ('/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/computer',

	2005-01-24  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c (mopts_collect): Remove debugging

	until we find a hal device object that can be our parent.

	* hald/linux2/coldplug.c: Euwh, too much simplification here; we
	need to insert class devs between bus devs in the coldplug queue
	as e.g. scsi_host is a class dev but sits between bus devs.

	* hald/linux2/classdev.h: Make hotplug_event_begin_add_classdev take
	the sysfs path of the corresponding device in /sys/devices (which
	may not be a physical device, e.g. class scsi_host)

	* hald/linux2/ids.h (ids_find_pnp): Add prototype

	* hald/linux2/ids.c (ids_find_pnp): New function; just use
	a hardcoded array and do a slow O(n) search (might want to
	optimize this later)

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c (add_classdev_after_probing): Compute
	UDI may fail; remember to clean up

	* hald/linux2/Makefile.am: Add pcmcia_utils.[ch] as we'll need
	them until sysfs got the right properties

	* hald/linux2/pcmcia_utils.[ch]: New files; imported from old
	backend

	* hald/linux2/pcmcia_cs.h: Ditto

2005-01-19  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	get h-d-m working after this...

	* hald/linux2/classdev.c:
	(input_add): Don't set info.bus as it doesn't really make sense
	since it is a class device

	where we don't have to think about asynchronous issues per
	logical device class.

	(input_helper_done): Deleted due to new framework

	* tools/device-manager/DeviceManager.py: Do not assume that
	info.bus is available

	* tools/device-manager/Representation.py: Do not assume that
	info.bus is available

2005-01-18  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/run-hald.sh: New file; used to run hald from the development
	directory. Sets up the appropriate path for external probing
	programs.

2005-01-18  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	the misbehaving child the hard way - suggestion from Joe Shaw.

	2005-01-12  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (HOTPLUG_TIMEOUT): Increase to 25 seconds
	to better cope with callouts timeout of 10 seconds

	* hald/callout.c (iochn_data): Cope with callouts terminating
	and free timeout handler
	(callout_timeout_handler): New function; kill callouts if they
	time out
	(process_next_callout): Setup timeout for callouts - set to
	ten seconds

	2005-01-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/callout.c: Simplify a lot more by demanding that callouts
	are run sequentially - which they are anyway since everything is
	serialized. Make a mental note to review and stress test this in
	the morning.

	2005-01-11  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/callout.c: Fix some craziness adding an idle handler for
	detecting when callouts complete - fixes bug on my new AMD64
	system with device add/remove prior to completion of callouts -
	one visible effect was that fstab-sync was crashing since it
	couldn't retrieve the block.device device as the device was
	removed prior to the completion of the callout

	drives (Red Hat bug #143834)

	* fdi/20freedesktop/ide-drives.fdi: ditto

2005-01-17  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	<richard@hughsie.com>. This is a patch for HAL CVS HEAD that
	provides all the system.* namespaces. I have not included the
	PMU/ACPI specific parts yet as we are still debating about how to
	include pmu.* and acpi.* in the most efficient way.

2005-01-07  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Check for popt when building fstab-sync and error

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (mii_get_link): Close the fd for link
	detection before getting the rate	

2004-12-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (fs_table_line_is_mounted): Patch from Sjoerd
	Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.  Running fclose on some random memory
	will crash the program. Fixed in attached patch.

2004-12-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Patch from
	Martin Pitt <martin@piware.de>.
	Media change detection for CD-ROMs does not work on some broken
	CD-ROM devices. There are some devices where the
	CDROM_DRIVE_STATUS ioctl returns CDS_DISK_OK even when the tray is
	open. This has the consequence that the event of inserting a CD is
	not recognized by hal.
	If the CD-ROM reports CDS_DISK_OK, then CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED should
	be checked twice. If it returns two different values, then there
	really was a media change and got_media can be set to true. OTOH,
	if both CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED events return the same value, then the
	tray is still open and we must not assume that there is already a
	CD in the drive.
	Second, for deciding the value of storage.cdrom.support_media_changed
	hald should not use the CDROM_MEDIA_CHANGED ioctl() (which returns
	the current state), but the CDC_MEDIA_CHANGED capability.

2004-12-08  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process): Only

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (compute_coldplug_visit_device): Descent down
	the to leafs of the /sys/devices tree but dont follow symlinks - done
	such that we can process sysfs trees with holes in them (cf. SCSI
	midlayer changes for kernel 2.6.10)

	* hald/linux/common.h: Remove prototypes for get_parent_sysfs_path()

	added to /etc/fstab); and b) default install wont corrupt
	multiboot systems on fixed drives (RH bug 137072)
	
2004-10-26  David Zeuthen  <davidz@redhat.com>

	Patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (link_detection_data_ready): The
	hal daemon does not check the sender's PID for netlink packets.
	Netlink packets can be sent by any user with local access to the
	system. Kernel originating packets have a PID of 0, while user
	space originating packets are > 0. Without checking this, users
	may send messages to hald that cause daemons using dbus to take
	inappropriate actions.

	Patch from Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@canonical.com>.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (add_device): Check whether given_sysfs_path

	(fs_table_add_volume): Only add removable selinux context for
	hotpluggable drives and drives with removable media

	* configure.in: Add fstab-sync secondary keyword which is useful for
	migration from e.g. kudzu to managed - fstab-sync will only delete
	fstab lines with the secondary keyword but never write them. Needs
	to be enabled with --enable-mnt-noop-sec.
	Also add fstab-sync access keyword which defaults to 'user' but
	can be replaced by 'console' - this is useful for specifying the
	extra mount option for how to give access. Now the access keyword
	needs to be enabled with --enable-mnt-access.

	For (my own) reference, this is the parameters used to bootstrap
	when building for Red Hat distros

	./autogen.sh --enable-mnt-noop --enable-fstab-sync --enable-hotplug-map 
	--with-mnt-noop=managed --enable-mnt-noop-sec --with-mnt-noop-sec=kudzu 
	--enable-mnt-access --with-mnt-access=console --with-init-scripts=redhat 
	--with-pid-file=/var/run/haldaemon.pid --enable-selinux

	note: the util-linux package must be patched with the patch in RH bug
	133941 in order for --with-mnt-access=console to work; should hit 
	Rawhide soon.

2004-09-29  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	USB floppy drive by looking at interface class instead

2004-09-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* libhal/libhal.c (hal_shutdown): Remember to init error var

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (add_udi): Add a whitelist so if a volume stems
	from a msdos style partition table we require that type to be in the
	whitelist; initially includes various FAT formats, NTFS and Linux.
	(volume_new): Fix a bug in size computation

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.h: Add prototype for
	hal_volume_get_msdos_part_table_type

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c:
	(hal_volume_get_msdos_part_table_type): New function

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process): 
	Rename x86_type to msdos_part_table_type

2004-09-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Added nl to ALL_LINGUAS

	* po/nl.po: Dutch translations from Reinout van 
	Schouwen <reinout@cs.vu.nl>

	error variable was errornously deleted before committing it

2004-09-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug_map.c: 
	Since a few days debians libgphoto2 also ships the an usb
	usermap. Attaches patch makes hal work with this :)

2004-09-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* libhal/libhal.c:
	(struct LibHalContext_s): add is_shutdown field
	(filter_func): if ctx->is_shutdown is TRUE don't process the message.
	Return NOT_YET_HANDLED instead of HANDLED on all messages as several
	libhal contexts may want to process them.
	(hal_initialize): Set ctx->is_shutdown to FALSE
	(hal_shutdown): Remove the matching rule on the Manager object and
	set is_shutdown to TRUE. Don't fix the leak on the DBusConnection
	because leaking it means that the application will terminate. Hence
	introduce a leak of the LibHalContext since shutdown is async. Add
	a few TODO comments about that this needs fixing (probably needs
	dbus_bus_get_dedicated).

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (sender_has_superuser_privileges): New function
	(device_set_property): Require superuser
	(device_add_capability): Require superuser

	(hal_drive_from_udi): Read storage.icon.* and storage.requires_eject
	(hal_drive_requires_eject): New function

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process): Add
	and set boolean property storage.requires_eject; right now we
	only add it for optical drives. Interestingly enough, my iPod Mini
	requires to be ejected as well (see RH bug #132195 for some
	discussion). 

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add docs for storage.requires_eject, 
	storage.icon.drive and storage.icon.volume

2004-09-24  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c :
	(hal_volume_policy_should_be_visible): s/moint/mount/ so the code
	actually compiles :-/

	* libhal-storage/libhal-storage.c: Delete some uncommented code
	(hal_volume_policy_should_be_visible): Accept a new parameter called
	target_mount_point since we need to evaluate policy on unmounted 
	volumes and want to blacklist them in advance. Add documentation.
	(hal_drive_find_all_volumes): New function to find all volumes
	belonging to a drive

2004-09-24  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_lvm2),
	(volume_id_probe): probe for all raid types first, cause
	probes for real filesystems may just be successful on raid
	members

2004-09-24  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hal-storage.pc.in: New file

	* Makefile.am: Add libhal-storage and po to SUBDIRS. Add hal-storage.pc

2004-09-23  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: (block_class_pre_process): fix
	matching of volume_id partition index to block device partition index

2004-09-21  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: (block_class_accept):
	skip legacy floppies here, until we get proper sysfs links to the
	platform device and switch over to merge floppies into that device.
	Legacy floppies handled until that in platform_bus_device.c

	I'm working on fixing the kernel sysfs /device-links and with such
	a link hald probes legacy floppies with block_class_device.c which
	we don't want right now cause it can block the whole process.

2004-09-21  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Martin Pitt <martin.pitt@canonical.com>
	
	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c (get_read_write_speed): Several
	Ubuntu users reported that hal does not start up properly. I
	debugged this and found out that hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c
	contains an unchecked buffer access which causes a segfault.  The
	attached patch fixes that; it might not be the most correct
	solution, but it works. The error is still present in 0.2.98; I
	made the fix in 0.2.92, but the patch should still apply.

2004-09-21  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process): Set
	has_removable_media for USB floppies in case the removable file in
	sysfs is gone

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (probe_msdos_part_table): 
	Don't set partition_number as it's gone

	volume.partition.number and volume.partition.x86_type properties

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (probe_msdos_part_table): Set
	partition_number and partition_msdosparttable_type
	
	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.h: Add partition_number and
	partition_msdosparttable_type members

2004-09-20  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_vfat): Trivial fix
	for debug output, the last iteration of the loop should end
	with 0 not -1

2004-09-19  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add section about policy agents and
	media insertion into drives that another application is holding
	a lock on.

2004-09-19  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (agent_device_matches): Removed
	(agent_merge_properties): Removed
	(agent_manager_remove): Removed

	* examples/locking.py: New file; shows how to use locking

2004-09-19  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.

	* hald/linux/usb_bus_device.c (usb_proc_parse): usb_proc_parse()
	parses /proc/bus/usb/devices but never closes the FILE struct,
	which obviously leads to a fd leak. Fixed in attached patch.

2004-09-19  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Alexander Larsson <alexl@redhat.com>. It seems that
	some models of cd-rw drives doesn't seem to support the GET
	CONFIGURATION command. At least mine returns sense 5h. However, to
	automatically support cdrom blanking, nautilus-cd-burner needs to
	correctly know if the medium is rewritable. Thus the attached
	patch uses the READ DISC INFORMATION command to get that
	information.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_disc): Use disc_is_rewriteable

	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c (disc_is_rewritable): New function

	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.h: Add prototype for new function

	(add_udi):
	(remove_udi):
	(clean): 
	Patch from Dan Walsh <dwalsh@redhat.com> to add fscontext to
	/etc/fstab for SELinux. Also removes patch that restored context
	for /etc/fstab since this is not needed.

2004-09-17  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* doc/TODO: Remove the device locking section, it's done now. Woo!

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add the Lock and Unlock methods to the
	spec.

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (raise_device_not_locked,
	raise_device_already_locked): New errors for the locking methods.
	(device_query_capability): Change the parsing to split up caps on
	spaces rather than doing a substring match.
	(device_lock): Implements the Lock dbus method, which grabs an
	advisory lock on a device.
	(device_unlock): Implements the Unlock dbus method.
	(service_deleted): Callback which releases locks when the locking
	service quits.
	(filter_function): Add a ServiceDeleted handler, check for Lock
	and Unlock methods.
	(hald_dbus_init): Add a match for the ServiceDeleted signal so we
	can see when things disconnect from the bus.

	* libhal/libhal.c (hal_device_lock): Added.  Takes an advisory
	lock for a device.
	(hal_device_unlock): Releases the lock.

2004-09-17  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_vfat):
	Fix endless loop for FAT32 volumes where the root directory
	cluster chain is not terminated. Follow a maximum of 100 clusters
	now and stop searching if we find a directory-end entry.

2004-09-17  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Steve Grubb <linux_4ever@yahoo.com>.

	* configure.in: Add HALD_PID_FILE to config.h

	* hald/hald.c:
	(delete_pid): New function
	(main): Write pidfile. Set atexit to delete_pid.

	* hald/haldaemon.in: Don't write pidfile

2004-09-16  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Revisit networking. Basically a) split ethernet and wireless into
	net.80203 and net.80211 properties; b) support renaming of
	devices; c) use uint64 datatype; d) add property for whether an

	Only check rate for net.80203 devices (fixes crasher for my new
	Atheros card; remember?)
	(net_class_pre_process): Rename from net.ethernet to net.80203 and
	also have separate net.80211 namespace. Add net.interface_up and
	net.linux.ifindex properties. Set net.{80203,80211}.mac_address
	as a uint64 rather than net.ethernet.{mac_addr,mac_addr_upper24,
	mac_addr_lower24}.
	(net_class_accept): Small reorg of code

	(main): pass on net_ifindex value to hotplug msg

2004-09-15  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_hfs_hfsplus):
	Copy over extents array for later examination. Fixes the
	label reading of a 40 GB hfsplus volume that I found on
	my neighbours desk.

2004-09-15  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (foreach_device_match_get_udi_tdl): New function
	(manager_find_device_string_match): Also return devices in the TDL
	that has a non-temporary UDI

2004-09-14  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (set_uuid): Swicht from
	length parameter to the type of uuid to be able to use the

	by type instead of length


2004-09-14  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Patch from: Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>

	* hald/linux/multimedia_class_device.c:
	Debian does have the v4l2 stuff in the kernel headers. So just
	copying causes the compile to fail on my system. Luckily it
	defines HAVE_V4L2, so we can check for that.

2004-09-14  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	Change Hotplug handling to better match the kernel. The next kernel
	version will have a u64 hotplug sequence number starting at 1.
	We can't be sure, that an ACTION != "add" is everytime a "remove" event,
	change that to pass the action string around instead of the flag.

	* hald/linux/hald_helper.h:
	* hald/linux/osspec.c:
	* tools/linux/hal_dev.c:
	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c:
	Change the hal_message structure to carry the u64 sequence number
	and the ACTION as a string. Change message type to an enum. Rename
	devnode to devname to match the udev name.
	Use the u64 sequence number and change the logic not to rely on
	negative numbers. The first sequence number will never be 0 in the
	kernel, so we use it if we don't get one from udev.

2004-09-14  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (cdrom_get_properties): Also set
	storage.cdrom.dvdrw to FALSE. Add note about we should be giving 
	the SCSI ioctl stuff some love soon.

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (probe_vfat): Don't le16_to_cpu
	for vs->sectors_per_cluster - it's a 8-bit quantity. Fixes bug with
	one of my FAT32 volume labels

2004-09-13  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/multimedia_class_device.c:
	(multimedia_class_device_accept), (multimedia_class_pre_process):
	New file for initial support of video4linux devices. It's just
	a starting point and we need more input from users of v4l
	devices. For a simple webcam it currently looks like this:
	   multimedia.device = '/udev/video0'  (string)
	   info.category = 'multimedia'  (string)
	   multimedia.video.can_capture = true  (bool)
	   multimedia.audio.has_audio = false  (bool)
	   multimedia.tuner.has_tuner = false  (bool)
	   multimedia.linux.version = 'v4l'  (string)
	   info.udi = '/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/usb_device_5a9_a511_100_-1_noserial'  (string)

	* hald/linux/osspec.c:  Add the new multimedia_class_handler to
	probe for video device properties on device discovery

	* tools/device-manager/Representation.py: Change "video" to
	"multimedia" to have a nice icon for the screenshots :)

2004-09-13  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_hfs_hfsplus): Add
	  support for hfsplus with the physical location of the root node
	  specified by a higher extent as the first one. This fixes
	  the label reading on David's big hfsplus volume - I always
	  expected that the volume was broken :)
	  Also add initial support for hfs anf hfsplus uuid's.

2004-09-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_in_gdl): Force the
	initial poll if we support media_check_enabled; should fix some
	issues with the IBM USB Memory Stick that shockingly report
	/sys/block/<drive>/removable set to 0.

2004-09-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hal.conf.in: Fixup this file as it was broken. Reported by 
	Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>.

2004-09-12  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_vfat): Patch from
	  Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net> to fix vfat label reading
	  on big endian systems

2004-09-07  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (hald_helper_hotplug_process_queue): Check
	for duplicate events and ignore them

2004-09-07  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>

	* configure.in: 
	* hald/Makefile.am: 
	All binaries generated by hal currently have -lexpat in their
	LDFLAGS. Which by itself is not a problem, except that libtool
	puts it as a library dependency in libhal.la. Which is ofcourse
	unnecessary. Attached patch fixes this by using the expat link
	option only for the hald binary.  No screenshot for this one
	though :)

2004-09-03  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Martin Pitt <martin@piware.de>.

	* hal.conf.in: Drop AgentManager interface. Allow both HAL_USER
	and root to own the org.freedesktop.Hal service.
	
	* hald/Makefile.am: Link with libcap
	
	* hald/hald.c: (usage), (drop_privileges), (main):
	add option --drop-privileges which causes hald not to run as root,
	but as @HAL_USER@ in @HAL_GROUP@ and all additional groups set in
	/etc/group, and keeping the necessary capabilities to do its
	job. This does _not_ change the default behaviour, if the option
	is not specified, hald runs as root, as before.

2004-09-03  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Martin Pitt <martin@piware.de>.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: (cdrom_get_properties),
	(detect_media):
	* hald/linux/input_class_device.c: (input_class_pre_process):
	* hald/linux/printer_class_device.c: (printer_class_pre_process):
	Intercept unchecked ioctl calls and log failures.

2004-09-02  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/device.c (hal_device_property_get_bool): Aiee!  If the
	property is not found, we want to return FALSE instead of -1.

	* hald/property.c (hal_property_get_bool): Return FALSE if the
	type isn't boolean in the assertion, not -1.

	* hald/linux/common.c (rename_and_merge): Fix some broken logic
	which only worked because it was depending on -1 being returned
	from boolean functions.  If I understand its original intent
	correctly, it should still work.  (Of course, info.not_available
	is never set to TRUE programmatically, so unless it's set in FDI
	files it never actually comes up)

	* doc/TODO: Update the "Computer" HalDevice item, remove a 
	duplicate item.

2004-09-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Jon Lech Johansen <jon@nanocrew.net>. Add support for
	properties of 64-bit unsigned integers. Right now this is not used
	as the D-BUS python bindings needs a patch.

	* hald/device.c: (hal_device_merge_with_rewrite),
	(hal_device_merge), (hal_device_matches),
	(hal_device_property_get_uint64), (hal_device_property_set_uint64),

2004-09-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (fs_table_line_is_mounted): New function
	(fs_table_remove_generated_entries): Don't remove generated entries
	that are in use (e.g device mounted at path). Fixes problem with
	restarting the hal daemon with devices mounted (e.g. on package
	upgrade etc.)

	* hald/callout.c (process_callouts): Print full path of callout

2004-09-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	This was a fun debugging session that led to this fix :-)
	Basically when building optimized binaries (like for the Fedora
	RPMS) an interesting sideeffect showed up: gobject signal handlers
	are run in arbritrary order. This means that we were processing
	hotplug events for sda%d before sda was added; which resulted in
	the unavailability of the kids because they couldn't find their
	parent.  Now we look at the device store to infer when to process
	the next event. Which is more correct and actually makes hal
	work. This *never* once showed up when not building without
	--build=i686-redhat-linux-gnu --host=i686-redhat-linux-gnu
	--target=i386-redhat-linux-gnu. Oh well.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (process_coldplug_list_on_gdl_store_add): 
	Renamed from _callouts_done_for_device
	(process_coldplug_list): Wait for device to be added to GDL instead
	of relying on callouts to complete (device obj may not have been added
	to GDL just because the callouts complete)
	(reenable_hotplug_on_gdl_store_add): Renamed from reeanble_hotplug_proc
	(reenable_hotplug_on_gdl_store_remove): New function
	(hald_helper_hotplug): Rather look at the GDL for additions and
	removals than looking at whether callouts complete

2004-08-31  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: Don't wait for 'removable' file - it just
	isn't available for non-top-level block devices (duh)

2004-08-31  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: 
	(detect_media): Don't poll on drives with storage.removable set to FALSE
	(block_class_pre_process): Use the /sys/block/<drive>/removable file
	
	* tools/device-manager/DeviceManager.py: Don't print out Conditions;
	should give us more headroom until D-BUS is fixed wrt. rules maximum
	and subscription of signals in the python bindings
	
	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: Wait for 'removable' file for 'block'
	system events

2004-08-31  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: (wait_for_sysfs_info): Fix timout
	calculation and don't wait for usb-files if we are called for a
	usb class, just wait for a dev file

2004-08-31  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (clean): Call restore_selinux_context if we
	have selinux

2004-08-31  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/Makefile.am (hald_SOURCES): Also add volume_id_logging.h so
	distribution tarballs work

2004-08-30  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_linux_raid): Skip very
	very small volumes, caus our end of volume calculation is wrong in
	that case.

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id_logging.h: Add a new file
	to wrap the HAL logging facility into volume_id

2004-08-30  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/linux/Makefile.am (uninstall-local): Get the uninstall rules
	right for 10-hal.dev and 20-hal.hotplug 

2004-08-30  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: (open_temp_fstab_file), (add_udi),
	(remove_udi), (clean): Go back to creating the temporary
	file in /etc. Add note about using /tmp (giving up atomicity)
	if /etc is in general readonly

2004-08-30  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Add SELinux checks
	
	* tools/Makefile.am: Build fstab-sync with selinux support if applicable
	
	* tools/fstab-sync.c: 
	(restore_selinux_context): New functions
	(add_udi): Use restore_selinux_context
	(remove_udi): Use restore_selinux_context
	
	* tools/linux/Makefile.am: Install hal.hotplug and hal.dev symlinks
	prefixed with 20- respectively 10-.

2004-08-29  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/linux/Makefile.am (install-data-local): Use 20-hal.hotplug for
	hotplug helper and 10-hal.dev for dev.d helper. Suggested by Kay
	Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>.

2004-08-29  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Set volume.fsusage
	to empty string by default
	(block_class_pre_process): Also set volume.fsusage to empty string by
	default. Set storage.drive_type to disk by default (should now work
	the the ub kernel driver instead of usb-storage)

	* hald/hald.c (main): Print out version

	* tools/linux/hal_dev.c (main): Put in option for more debug

2004-08-28  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: Add some more files to wait for
	(wait_for_sysfs_info): Only wait 10 secs (should be enough; we're
	waiting for the kernel)

2004-08-28  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>
	
	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: 
	(block_class_visit): Fail if parent isn't already there (this and
	other things should close RH Bug #131154)

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c: 
	(bus_device_visit): Fail if parent isn't already there

	* hald/linux/class_device.c:
	(class_device_visit): Fail if parent isn't already there; return
	NULL if we merge onto parent. Leave TODO about how to deal with
	this (other devices will be processed while we merge; probably
	not a big deal since we don't yet have callouts)
	(class_device_final): Add a TODO about running callouts when merge
	is complete

	* hald/linux/osspec.c:
	(process_coldplug_list_callouts_done_for_device): Also discon. cancelled
	(process_coldplug_list_device_cancelled): Also discon. done_for_device
	(process_coldplug_list): Pass coldplug_list as param to cancelled
	(reenable_hotplug_proc_on_device_cancel): Also disconnect _proc
	(reenable_hotplug_proc): Also disconnect _cancel

2004-08-28  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c:
	(get_first_valid_partition), (detect_media): Fix leftover from
	volume_id name change, which broke no_partitions media.
	Clarify comments only a few lines apart, to not claim the direct
	opposite

2004-08-27  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c:
	(probe_lvm1), (probe_lvm2): Add detection of LVM physical drives
	(probe_linux_raid): add version number of raid

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.h: We are at version 021 now.
	It started as a replacement of the FAT label reading code in HAL.
	I _never_ expected that we seek over the whole disk now to search
	for raid signatures and support nearly every filesystem I've ever
	had a formatting tool for :)

2004-08-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* AUTHORS: Add Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org> cause he rocks.
	Sort the list in alphabetical order of surname (I'm just soo
	political correct :-)

	* fdi/20freedesktop/canon-digital-ixus-v.fdi: Merge onto usb_device
	since we really don't know what interface to target

	* hald/linux/hald_helper.h: Change comment about seqnum

	* hald/linux/libsysfs/sysfs_dir.c (sysfs_open_link): Patch from
	Steve Grubb <linux4_ever@yahoo.com> to fix leak on error condition.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: 
	(add_computer_callouts_done): Move from TDL to GDL
	(osspec_probe): Add to TDL; callouts may need it (seen by Kristof
	Vansant <de_lupus@pandora.be>
	(hald_helper_device_node): Print out seqnum
	(hald_helper_data): Pass seqnum

	* hald/logger.h: Ignore ENABLE_VERBOSE_MODE; always compile all
	logging statements in (should take the heat of some bugreports)

	* tools/linux/hal_dev.c (main): Pass seqnum if available; otherwise
	pass -1.

2004-08-26  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Don't check for a C++ compiler... we don't have
	any C++ code.

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add a section about kernel properties.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (osspec_probe): Get kernel info from uname()
	and add the properties to the Computer device.

2004-08-26  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add description of "volume.fsusage"

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c:
	(set_volume_id_values): Use "volume.fsusage" instead of "is_filesystem"
	and "is_part_of_raid"
	(detect_media), (block_class_pre_process): Set missing defaults and
	remove "is_filesystem"

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_linux_raid),
	(probe_msdos_part_table), (probe_ext), (probe_reiserfs),
	(probe_xfs), (probe_jfs), (probe_vfat), (probe_udf),
	(probe_iso9660), (probe_ufs), (probe_mac_partition_map),
	(probe_hfs_hfsplus), (probe_ntfs), (probe_swap): Switch naming
	form "format" and "type" to "type" and "usage" to match the
	names we use in HAL now. 

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: (udi_is_volume_or_nonpartition_drive):
	Switch from "is_filesystem" to "volume.fsusage" to determine
	if the volume is mountable

2004-08-25  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug_map.c (main): Match usb_device rather
	than usb since we don't want to merge onto interfaces.

2004-08-25  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Add option for new callout hal-hotplug-map
	
	* hald/device.[ch]: Add the "cancelled" signal and hal_device_cancel
	method

	* hald/hald.c (main): Avoid daemonization for now; will make hald
	hang if anything fails up-until device probing (RH bug 130849)

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_got_device_file):
	Cancel the device if don't get the device file

	* hald/linux/common.h: Increase timeout to 60 secs. Make note
	about we really need the SEQNUM support in udev

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: 
	(process_coldplug_list_device_cancelled): New function
	(process_coldplug_list): Add support for cancelling
	(reenable_hotplug_proc_on_device_cancel): New function
	(hald_helper_hotplug): Add support for cancelling
	(hotplug_sem_up): Add some helpful debug
	(hotplug_sem_down): Add some helpful debug
	(hald_helper_data): Add some helpful debug

	* tools/Makefile.am: Also remove callout on uninstall

	* tools/fstab-sync.c:
	(fs_table_remove_volume): Only require device_file not complete Volume
	object
	(remove_udi): Don't require storage device to be present (fixes some
	problems when unplugging unpartitioned media as we don't get hotplug
	event and things are thus not serialised)

	* tools/linux/Makefile.am: Build and, optionally, install 
	hal-hotplug-map callout

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug_map.c: New program; a tad Red Hat specific
	wrt. file locations; patches are welcome. The single purpose of
	this callout is to detect gphoto2 supported cameras and libsane
	supported scanners using usermap files in /etc/hotplug.

2004-08-25  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c:
	(set_volume_id_values), (get_first_valid_partition),
	(volume_set_size), (detect_media), (block_class_pre_process): Add
	"volume.is_part_of_raid" and pass the size of the volume down to
	volume_id to be able to look for a raid superblock at the end of
	the device.
	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c:
	(probe_linux_raid) : Add linux_raid detection with reading of the
	raid set uuid
	(probe_msdos_part_table): follow extended partiton while probing
	(vfat_search_label_in_dir), (probe_vfat): Support reding of labels
	stored in the directory of FAT32 and read the whole root directory
	instead of only the first cluster
	(probe_mac_partition_map): return UNUSED and PARTITIONTABLE types
	for know Apple partitions
	(volume_id_probe): Add raid detection, if volume_id is called with
	the size of the volume.

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media):
	(block_class_pre_process): Set volume.is_filesystem to FALSE by default

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (osspec_probe): Add info.udi to computer
	(process_shutdown_list_callouts_done_for_device): New function
	(process_shutdown_list): New function
	(shutdown_add_recursively_to_list): New function
	(osspec_shutdown): Completely rewrite the shutdown code

	* hald/haldaemon.in: Add 'sleep 3' when restarting the hal daemon
	to get a chance for the shutdown callouts to run

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/Makefile.am (install-data-local): Install the fstab-sync
	if applicable.

	* configure.in: Add the --enable-fstab-sync option to automatically
	install a 50-fstab-sync.hal symlink to fstab-sync.

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/hald.c (main): Setup a pipe and make parent wait until client
	writes to it.
	(osspec_probe_done): Write to the parent to make it exit

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/hald.c (main): Move daemonazation back to beginning (fixes
	fdo bug #1165) for now

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (force_unmount): Don't clear the 
	volume.* properties

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (rem_device): Call the removed method on the
	ClassDeviceHandler

	* tools/fstab-sync.c:
	(fs_table_add_volume): Only use fstype auto for optical and floppy
	drives; ignore the rest if fstype cannot be probled (fixes *some*
	issues with RAID partitions getting added to fstab)
	(volume_determine_mount_point): Complete rewrite; this was broken
	for ieee1394 drives. Also check if the directory is available
	in /media or whatever the root is
	(fs_table_remove_generated_entries): Also remove directory in
	/media. Fixed a bug where only every other line was removed.

2004-08-23  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (fs_table_has_volume): Properly resolve symlinks
	that aren't fully qualified

2004-08-23  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c:
	(probe_msdos_part_table),
	(volume_id_probe): Patch from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>
	to move msdos partition table probing to the end of the list.
	He found a ext3 with msdos signature on the first block.
	Also add a check if all partitions are empty, so  we do not
	recognize it as a msdos partition table.

2004-08-22  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/callout.c: Only invoke callouts if they have the .hal extension.
	Export HALD_VERBOSE if the hald instance is started with verbose.
	Add HALD_STARTUP resp. HALD_SHUTDOWN only if the callout is in response
	to hald starting up/shutting down.

	* hald/hald.c: Add an verbose option. Use the HALD_VERBOSE environment
	variable. Postpone daemonization until we are done probing.

	* hald/hald.h: Move hald_is_[verbose|initialising|is_shutting_down] here

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c: 
	(bus_device_visit): We can now always assume we got a parent

	* hald/linux/class_device.c: 
	(class_device_visit): We can now always assume we got a parent

	* hald/linux/common.h:

	* hald/linux/drive_id/drive_id.c:

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: Complete rewrite of probing code; now we
	construct a list of ''coldplug events'' and feed them to the
	two new functions add_device() and rem_device(); this unifies 
	a few codepaths and it's much faster, cleaner and just yummier. 
	Also ensure that callouts are run sequentially.

	* hald/logger.c: 
	(logger_enable),
	(logger_disable): New functions 
	(logger_emit): Print time and don't print function name

	* hald/logger.h: Add logger_[enable|disable].

	* tools/fstab-sync.c:
	(open_temp_fstab_file): Use /tmp for the temporary file
	(fs_table_has_volume): Remove debug spew
	(add_udi): Log a message to the syslog on success
	(remove_udi): Log a message to the syslog on success
	(clean): Log a message to the syslog on success
	(main): Use HALD_VERBOSE. When invoked for the ''computer'' device
	object on hald startup, automatically clean the fstab (but only if
	using a managed keyword). Don't remove entries on hald
	shutdown. In line with the osspec.c changes (sequential callouts)
	we now get a fully sanitized /etc/fstab at hald startup, Yay!

	* tools/linux/hal_dev.c: (main): Less syslog spamming

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: 
	(wait_for_sysfs_info): Less syslog spamming
	(main): Less syslog spamming

2004-08-20  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (probe_reiserfs),
	(probe_swap): Export format_version for reiser and swap

2004-08-19  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: Lot's of changes: remove old locking code;
	fix security issue (remove dev,suid) with the given mount options 
	(RH bug #130290); Use a, pretty lame perhaps, heuristic to add 
	noatime,sync for hotpluggable volumes smaller than 1GB. Check device 
	mentioned in /etc/fstab for symlink and if found, update the 
	block.device property in HAL if applicable; Use macros for mount
	root and noop keyword (see configure.in changes).	

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (volume_set_size): New function
	(detect_media): Call volume_set_size
	(block_class_pre_process): Call volume_set_size

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add documentation for volume.block_size
	and volume.num_blocks.

	* configure.in: Add gobject>=2.2.2 to PKG_CHECK_MODULES. Patch from 
	Steve Grubb <linux_4ever@yahoo.com>. Added some configuration options
	for fstab-sync.
	
2004-08-19 Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: Add volume.fsversion to the
	volume if avalable. Currently FAT12, FAT16, FAT32, and the
	NTFS version unmber is supported.

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.[ch]: bump to version 013
	o remove msdos probe type (handled by vfat now)
	o introduce format_version to return the filesystem version
	  if available. We can provide vfat(FAT32) or NTFS(3.1) now.
	o no longer trust the version string in the fat superblock,
	  it's not correct to do this. The type of FAT is _only_ de-
	  termined by the count of clusters.
	o vfat's "NO NAME" is a empty label now
	o support for FAT labels stored in the directory instead of the
	  superblock (XP does this). volume_id ignores the label in the
	  superblock if you have a label in the directory.

2004-08-17  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (volume_new): Use vfat instead of msdos

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (probe_msdos): Revert ugly hack

2004-08-17  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Patch from Tim Gerla <tim@gerla.net>. It looks
	like the configure script for hal doesn't properly handle
	--with-pid-file as an argument, because of the glitch illustrated
	by the patch I've attached.

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (probe_msdos): Introduce a
	hack where this is set to vfat instead.

	* hald/linux/hald_helper.h (HALD_HELPER_SOCKET_PATH): Don't use
	the local prefix, always use /var, cause otherwise it's difficult
	when developing on hal and using a local prefix (we want to use
	the installed hal.dev, hal.hotplug from a package)

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.[ch]: Patch from Kay Sievers
	<kay.sievers@vrfy.org>. Long weekend with a few rain showers, so
	here is a update to volume_id :). We finally get the same uuid for
	a ntfs volume on Windows and with HAL. Also msdos extended
	partitons are handled now.

2004-08-16  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.97

2004-08-16  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Add the --enable-fstab-op to specify whether we
	want to use a keyword (currently kudzu) when adding entries
	to the fstab. Default is off

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c:
	(block_class_visit): Only return the HalDevice if the parent exists
	(detect_media): Print out debug statement when we forcibly probe
	for media
	(block_class_pre_process): Detect the ide-cs driver by looking at
	the sysfs path (!) and set the media_check_enable to FALSE.  Only
	do volume_id and drive_id probing if storage.media_check_enabled
	is TRUE. Sets the volume.fstype to 'vfat,msdos,auto' in this case.
	Fixes issues with the ide-cs driver
	(block_class_in_gdl): Add a comment about how we could defer
	the check for non-partitioned media via a timeout
	(deferred_check_for_non_partition_media): The function to check
	for media; not currently used
	(mtab_handle_storage): Use detect_media() to add the new child
	when a non-partition volume we didn't know about was mounted
	(mtab_handle_volume): Remove non partitioned media on drives
	that can't be polled when it's unmounted.

	(bus_device_visit): Only return the HalDevice if the parent exists

	* hald/linux/class_device.c:
	(class_device_visit): Only return the HalDevice if the parent exists
	(class_device_got_parent_device): Print out the sysfs path instead
	of the HAL UDI
	
	* hald/linux/ide_bus_device.c:
	(ide_device_accept): New function; currently the same as the super
	class but useful for testing
	
	* hald/linux/ide_host_bus_device.c:
	(ide_host_device_accept): Don't pickup toplevel ide_host objects
	cause they're not hotplugged anyway (thus no way to remove them)
	
	* tools/fstab-sync.c: 
	(volume_new): Also check if the volume.fstype is empty

2004-08-15  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Sends messages from hotplug and device naming helpers via a local
	socket. Reorder the hotplug events we receive in hald according to
	SEQNUM and use a semaphor pattern to ensure that we don't process
	a hotplug event before the device created in effect to the
	previous event is completely processed (e.g.  add/remove callouts
	have run).

	* hald/Makefile.am: Remove scsi_host_class_device.c and add
	scsi_bus_device.c, hald_helper.h.

	* hald/device_info.c: 
	(handle_match): Comment out debug
	(scan_fdi_files): Comment out debug

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: 
	(block_class_visit): Return the HalDevice* object
	(block_class_pre_process): Use 'scsi' instead of 'scsi_device'
	(block_class_compute_udi): -do-
	(mtab_handle_volume): Comment out debug
	(etc_mtab_process_all_block_devices): Comment out debug

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c:

	(net_class_compute_udi): Comment out debug
	(net_class_udev_event): New function to ignore the udev event (duh)

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: Remove the ClassDeviceHandler scsi_device_
	class_device in favour of the BusDeviceHandler scsi_bus_device
	(visit_class_device): Return the HalDevice* object
	(visit_device): Return the HalDevice* object
	(osspec_init): Listen for datagrams on a local socket from hal.dev
	and hal.hotplug

	(remove_class_device): Return the HalDevice* object
	(handle_hotplug): Removed
	(handle_device_event): Removed
	(osspec_filter_function): Is empty now. We got our information via
	a local socket now
	(reenable_hotplug_proc): New function
	(hald_helper_hotplug): New function
	(hald_helper_device_node): New function
	(hald_helper_hotplug_process_queue): New function

	* hald/linux/scsi_bus_device.c: New file

	* hald/linux/scsi_device_class_device.c: Removed

	* hald/linux/scsi_generic_class_device.c:

	device file information to scsi.generic_device instead

	* tools/device-manager/Const.py.in: s/scsi_device/scsi/

	* tools/linux/Makefile.am: Don't link with D-BUS

	* tools/linux/hal_dev.c:
	(get_sysfs_mnt_path): Removed
	(main): Send the message via a local socket instead

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c:
	(main): Send the message via a local socket instead

2004-08-13  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: All debug statements now prints the pid
	(volume_determine_device_type): Aiih. Due to hal not removing all
	children devices before parent devices and the fact that we use
	properties on a parent device when removing a volume we end up
	with a problem. Thing is, we don't need this info when removing
	fstab entries so simple fix is to call hal_device_exists() for the
	UDI.
	(volume_new): Typo, volume.fs_type should be volume.fstype
	(add_udi): Print out debug when an entry was added
	(remove_udi): Print out debug when an entry was removed
	(clean):
	(main): Use flock(2) to lock the /etc/fstab file. Also bail out
	when there are no info.capabilities and we were invoked by hald.
	Store PID in the global variable pid.

	* doc/TODO: Added TODO about removing childs before their parent

2004-08-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.96

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Include example-manager.py instead of
	examply-manager.py. Sigh.

	* doc/spec/examply-manager.py: Removed

2004-08-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Rewrite block.no_partitions spec.
	Add storage.[serial|firmware_version] which was forgotton.
	
	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Set to
	value of storage.no_partitions_hint to honor the new spec when
	creating a volume for media with no partition tables.

	"auto" as target filesystem if not known
	(fs_table_has_volume): Remove debug printfs
	(fs_table_add_volume): Use hal properties to determine mount flags
	(add_udi): Don't process volumes spawned from media w/o partitions
	(remove_udi): Don't process volumes spawned from media w/o partitions
	(main): Also handle capability 'storage'

2004-08-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c (udi_is_volume): Simplify this a bit given
	that cap volume always implies cap block
	(main): Check the HAL_INFO_PROP_INFO_CAPABILITIES which is set
	when invoked from hald to exit if it's not a volume

2004-08-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: Set emacs mode to GNU, include mntent.h
	(volume_new): Add label field
	(volume_free): Destroy label field
	(fs_table_has_volume): Renamed from fs_table_has_block_device,
	handle LABEL= entries in fstab by looking at the volume and
	looking up /etc/mtab
	(fs_table_add_volume): Invoke fs_table_has_volume instead
	of fs_table_has_block_device

2004-08-11  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Add docs for block.have_scanned,
	volume.is_filesystem, Device Conditions on volume device
	objects (now with new names), 'unknown' value for
	volume.disc.type, 'platform' value for storage.bus, rename
	storage.automount_enabled to storage.automount_enabled_hint. Add
	property storage.no_partitions_hint

	* hald/hald.conf:
	* hald/hald_conf.[ch]:
	Rename storage.automount_enabled to storage.automount_enabled_hint
	and remove storage.cdrom_eject_check_enabled.

	* hald/linux/platform_bus_device.c: (platform_device_pre_process):
	Set the correct properties for floppy drives

	* hald/property.c (hal_property_get_bool): Return FALSE instead of
	-1 if property not found.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: (set_volume_id_values),
	(get_child_device_gdl), (get_child_device_tdl),
	(block_class_visit), (cdrom_get_properties), (force_unmount),
	(force_unmount_of_all_childs), (get_first_valid_partition),
	(detect_disc), (detect_media), (block_class_pre_process),
	(mtab_handle_storage), (mtab_handle_volume):
	Unified codepaths for handling optical discs and other removable
	storage. Handle media with no partition table much nicer
	
	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (set_label_string),
	(set_label_unicode16), (set_uuid), (get_buffer),
	(probe_msdos_part_table), (probe_ext), (probe_reiser), (probe_xfs),
	(probe_jfs), (probe_vfat), (probe_msdos), (probe_udf),

	(probe_hfs_hfsplus), (probe_ntfs), (probe_swap), (volume_id_probe),
	(volume_id_close):
	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.h:
	Add support for parsing partition tables from Kay Sievers 
	<kay.sievers@vrfy.org>. Change 'reiser' to 'reiserfs' because
	the that's the name on Linux.
	
2004-08-11  Ray Strode  <rstrode@redhat.com>

	* tools/fstab-sync.c: don't require callout wrapper shell
	script.

2004-08-09  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>	

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Added some text about how storage_lun%d.*
	and storage.* properties are merged from the physical device object
	backing the block devices. Included .fdi example with 6in1 reader
	to further clarify this.

	* doc/spec/hal/hal-devices1.png: 
	* doc/spec/hal/hal-fdi-example1.png:
	Updated to show full device tree now that info.virtual is gone.

	* doc/spec/hal/hal-fdi-example2.png: New file

	interfaces since this is now done

	* hald/linux/usbif_bus_device.c (compute_name_from_if): New function

	* hald/linux/usb_bus_device.c: Rename all usb.* properties to
	usb_device.*

	* hald/linux/usbif_bus_device.c: Rename all usbif.* properties to
	usb.*. Merge usb_device.* properties from parent device. Essentially
	an USB interface is now like an USB device was except that it
	exports properties usb.interface.* to describe the USB interface

	* tools/device-manager/Const.py.in: 
	* tools/device-manager/Representation.py: 
	Handle the s/usb/usb_device/ and s/usbif/usb/ renamings

	* doc/spec/hal-spec.xml.in: Apply a patch from Kay with spelling/

	(probe_swap), (volume_id_probe), (volume_id_open_node):
	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.h:	
	Attached is a trivial cleanup of the enum names, cause 'ALL' is
	not a very good name in a global namespace. I've prepended the
	libname to all names.

2004-08-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_compute_udi):
	If model and serial numbers are not available (for USB or IEEE1394
	devices), use the UDI for storage.physical_device and append the
	SCSI LUN and prepend block_ to attain uniqueness.
	
	* hald/linux/scsi_device_class_device.c:
	(scsi_device_class_pre_process): Add capability 'scsi_device'
	
	* hald/linux/scsi_host_class_device.c:
	(scsi_host_class_pre_process): Add capability 'scsi_host'

2004-08-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Patch from Kay Sievers <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/Makefile.am:
	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: (block_class_pre_process),
	(block_class_compute_udi):
	* hald/linux/drive_id/drive_id.c: (dump), (set_str), (scsi_inq),
	(probe_scsi), (probe_ata), (drive_id_probe), (drive_id_open_fd),
	(drive_id_open_node), (drive_id_open_dev_t), (drive_id_close):
	* hald/linux/drive_id/drive_id.h:
	Here is the code, that reads the serial number of a drive,
	directly connected to an ATA or SCSI bus. HAL probes for the
	values and adds: storage.serial, storage.firmware_version,
	storage.revision if available.
	Note: This will only work on native interfaces. For devices behind
	USB, it's not possible to get any of these values. There are some
	bridges out there, which are capable to set the USB-values itself,
	to the values from a ATA Inquiry, but unfortunally, most of the
	bridges out there, don't do it.  "USB storage compliance" mandates
	a unique serial number, but most of the vendors seems not to care
	about it.
	I changed the compute_udi for block devices. If we get a serial
	number or a uuid we use it to compute the udi.

2004-07-30  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	Patch from Dan Williams <dcbw@redhat.com>

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (link_detection_handle_message):
	Fix a point arithmetic bug which caused link status changes to be
	missed.  Also fixes a compiler warning.

2004-07-30  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* tools/device-manager/Representation.py (get_icon): Use get()
	rather than indexing for "info.property" so that we can fall
	back and not throw an exception if a device doesn't have it
	set (as virtual devices often don't).

2004-07-30  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/hald.c (main): Update for the change to hald_dbus_init():
	don't get a DBusConnection from there, exit() if it fails.  Also
	update for the change to osspec_init(): don't pass in any
	arguments.

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (hald_dbus_init): Don't exit() anywhere here;
	instead return FALSE.  Tell dbus not to exit if we're disconnected
	from the bus.  Return TRUE on success, not a DBusConnection.
	(filter_function): Listen for the "Disconnected" signal on the
	"Local" dbus interface and if so, unref the connection and try to
	reconnect to the system bus every 3 seconds.
	(reinit_dbus): Try to reconnect to the system bus.

	* hald/osspec.h: Change osspec_init() to not take any parameters;
	the only backend (the Linux 2.6 one) wasn't using it.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (osspec_init): Take void instead of a
	DBusConnection.

2004-07-30  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

2004-07-29  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c: (get_buffer),
	(probe_hfs_hfsplus), (probe_ntfs), (volume_id_probe):
	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.h:
	Here is support for recognition of hfs and hfsplus filesystems on
	a main block device, like a CD. Only the first partition is
	returned with the probe.

2004-07-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): A mounted
	disc wasn't detected; this is now 'fixed'. Spotted by Sjoerd Simons.
	(is_mounted): New function to determine if a filesystem on a 
	device file is mounted

	Sjoerd Simons.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_visit): Fixed a nasty
	bug where .udev.sysfs_path were set before other key properties. This
	resulted in lack of information in handle_udev_node_created_found_device
	that was invoked as soon as .udev.sysfs_path were set. Obviously
	this situation was only applicable when we got the DeviceEvent before
	the HotplugEvent. udev is indeed fast.

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_visit): -do-

	non-virtual.

	* hald/linux/platform_bus_device.c (platform_device_pre_process):

	nice way.

2004-07-20  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c:
	(detect_media): use O_EXCL for optical drive media detection, much
	safer since O_EXCL is actually in mainline. Removes possible burning
	problems (that is, if only cdrecord open(2)'s the device using O_EXCL;
	bug filed against fedora-devel, hopefully it will bubble upstream)

	* tools/device-manager/DeviceManager.py:
	* tools/device-manager/LibGladeApplication.py:
	* tools/device-manager/hal-device-manager:
	Attached patch makes hal-device-manager shows the error about hald
	not running in a gtk messagedialog instead of on the
	console. Which ensures that when running it from the menu you see
	more then just a flash if hald isn't running :) Also it changes
	some deprecated functions to use their non-deprecated counterparts

2004-07-11  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (mtab_handle_storage): Consolidate
	three if statements into one. Also search TDL for child. Don't remove
	child if called second time.
	(mtab_handle_volume): Don't check volumes added by mtab_handle_storage
	e.g. volumes we detect on mount only

2004-07-07  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	that will detect media and process the mtab to update mount status

	* hald/linux/class_device.h: Add class_device_move_from_tdl_to_gdl()
	prototype

	link status property.

2004-06-09  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Set info.product
	to volume.label if it's set.
	(block_class_pre_process): Set info.product to volume.label if
	it's set, otherwise try to append the fstype to "Volume".

2004-06-09  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	Fix some refcounting issues

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: Unref the device after we add
	it to the TDL.
	(disc_add_to_gdl): Removed; it's functionally equivalent to
	device_move_from_tdl_to_gdl() in common.c.
	(disc_remove_from_gdl): Disconnect the signal handlers before
	removing from the TDL (and thus finalizing).
	(detect_media): Unref the child after adding it to the TDL.
	Replace signal handler for "callouts_finished".

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c (bus_device_visit): Unref device after
	adding it to the TDL.
	(bus_device_got_parent): Don't unref after removing from the TDL.

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_visit): Unref device
	after adding it to TDL.
	(class_device_got_parent_device, class_device_got_sysdevice,
	class_device_got_device_file, class_device_final): Don't unref
	after removing from the TDL.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (osspec_probe): Unref the fakeroot device
	after adding it to GDL.

2004-06-07  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* doc/TODO: Add an item about capability matching in FDI files.

	* fdi/20freedesktop/Makefile.am: Add lucent-pcmcia-wireless.fdi

	* fdi/20freedesktop/lucent-pcmcia-wireless.fdi: Added.  Matches
	Lucent WaveLAN cards and sets info.bus to pcmcia and a sane vendor
	and product.

	* tools/device-manager/Const.py.in: Add PCMCIA as a bus type.

2004-06-07  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Remove the iwlib dependency.

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c: Remove the wireless properties.
	This stuff is better suited to a library like iwlib
	(net_class_pre_process): But still check for the existence of the
	"wireless" directory and set the net.ethernet.80211 capability if
	it's there.

	* hald/hald_conf.c: Remove deprecated use of a label at the end of
	a function and just return instead of goto'ing there.

2004-06-07  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.92

	* packaging/fedora/hal.spec: Install the symlink in
	/etc/dev.d/default/hal.dev. Patch from Kristian Høgsberg
	<krh@bitplanet.net>. Bump version to 0.2.92

2004-06-06  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_visit): Add the
	block.no_partitions boolean property and set it to FALSE by
	default. If this is TRUE it means that media for this toplevel
	block device will appear as children but there can be at maximum
	one child and the block.device will be the same. This applies to
	floppy and cdrom media. This property have been introduced such
	that a callout can update the fstab in advance of media insertion
	on e.g. floppy drives and optical drives.
	(block_class_pre_process): Set block.no_partitions to TRUE for
	optical drives.

	* tools/callouts/fstab-update.sh: When block.no_partitions is TRUE
	create entry only for top-level block device.

2004-06-05  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* packaging/fedora/hal.spec: Add hald.conf to %files. Patch from
	Kristian Høgsberg <krh@bitplanet.net>

	* ChangeLog: Fixup the danish character ø in Kristians last name
	since we want to use ISO-8859-1 in ChangeLog :-)

2004-06-04  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	Patch from Kristian Høgsberg <krh@bitplanet.net>

	* hald/linux/input_class_device.c (input_class_accept): New
	function.  Accepts devices with no sysdevice but which begin with
	"event".  For built-in, non-sysfs input devices like PS/2 mice.
	(input_class_pre_process): Set the major and minor numbers as
	properties.  If there is no sysdevice, do an ioctl() on the device
	to try to get identifying info about it and set it in
	info.product.
	(input_class_compute_udi): Added.  Computes the UDI for devices
	that don't get merged onto parents.
	(input_class_handler): Use input-specific functions for the accept
	and compute_udi functions.

2004-06-03  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/linux/printer_class_device.c (printer_class_device_accept):
	Reject class devices that have no sysdevice.

2004-06-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/hald.conf: New file, policy for hal daemon

	* hald/Makefile.am: Install hald.conf into $sysconfdir/hal

	* hald/hald_conf.c (hald_read_conf_file): New function
	(cdata): New function
	(end): New function
	(start): New function
	(parsing_abort): New function

	* hald/hald.c (main): Call hald_read_conf_file to read the 
	configuration file

	* hald/hald_conf.h (hald_read_conf_file): Added hald_read_conf_file
	prototype

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process): add
	storage.cdrom capability if device is a cdrom

2004-06-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/hald_conf.[ch]: New files, vendor and user specific
	configuration of the HAL daemon

	* hald/Makefile.am (hald_SOURCES): Add hald_conf.[ch]

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process): Set
	storage.media_check_enabled and storage.automount_enabled to
	default value from HaldConf. Forgot to set volume.is_mounted to
	FALSE when building the device. NOTE: when media_check_enabled is
	set to FALSE use touch /dev/sda (or whatever) to force a poll for
	media. So, now to write a /etc/hal/hald.conf configuration file
	parser :-)
	(cdrom_check): Set storage.cdrom.eject_check_enabled to default
	value from HaldConf
	(detect_media): Disable continous printing of error when no medium
	is in storage device. Respect the storage.media_check_enabled and
	storage.cdrom.eject_check_enabled properties

	* hald/hald.c (main): Remove opt_run_as

2004-05-31  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* AUTHORS: Added Joe Shaw

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Add code for 
	checking whether the eject button is pressed on an optical drive.
	If detected the condition 'EjectPressed' is emitted on the disc
	HalDevice with a single string representing the device file.
	Also remove BAR and FOO debug statements from earlier development
	sessions. Yay.

2004-05-28  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (rehash_wireless): Forgot to change
	a couple of references of "net.ethernet.80211" to
	"net.ethernet.is_80211", so properties wouldn't get updated.

2004-05-27  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (volume_id_open_node): While
	debugging the file descriptor leak that stops cdroms being
	ejected, I noticed a theoretical file descriptor when the box runs
	out of memory. Patch from Crispin Flowerday <gnome@flowerday.cx>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_accept): Added this
	since 2nd level block devices, e.g. sda1, doesn't have sysdevices
	and the generic class_device_accept was changed to required this.

2004-05-26  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (parse_scanning_token): We're
	likely to get multiple SIOCGIWFREQ tokens.  If it's lower than
	1000, then it's the channel and not the frequency.  Ugh.

2004-05-26  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* configure.in: Add --enable-iwlib, and check for it so we can
	build the wireless functionality.

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c: Add wireless network support.
	Adds a bunch of properties for the current state of things, as
	well as scanning for networks.
	(open_wireless_sysfs_subdir): Open the sysfs "wireless" path and
	read in a bunch of properties.
	(get_wireless_properties): Use the iwlib API to extract a bunch of
	additional properties, like the protocol, frequency, crypto key,
	ESSID, mode (ad-hoc, managed, etc), access point mac address.
	Also start scanning for other available access points.
	(read_scanning_results, parse_scanning_token, aps_to_properties):
	helper functions to read in the scanning data and expose as
	properties the list of networks (not access points!) available.
	(net_class_pre_process): Call get_wireless_properties().
	(net_class_tick): Added.  Gets wireless properties every 5 ticks.
	(net_class_handler): Call net_class_tick() instead of
	class_device_tick().

2004-05-25  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* hald/Makefile.am: Add the ieee1394 class devices.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: Replace use of locally defined
	AsyncInfo with ClassAsyncData.

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c: Replace use of locally defined
	AsyncInfo with BusAsyncData.

	* hald/linux/class_device.c: Replace use of locally defined
	AsyncInfo with ClassAsyncData.
	(class_device_accept): Check here if the class device has a
	sysdevice and reject it if it doesn't.
	(class_device_visit): Don't check for it here.  If it is NULL, set
	merge_or_add to FALSE so that we don't try to merge it onto a fake
	device.  If the sysdevice is NULL, set the parent sysfs path to
	"(none)", which will match our fake parent device.
	(class_device_final): Take a third argument for merge_or_add and
	check it instead of the ClassDeviceHandler's default behavior.

	* hald/linux/ieee1394_class_device.c,
	hald/linux/ieee1394_host_class_device.c,
	hald/linux/ieee1394_node_class_device.c: New IEEE1394 class device
	implementation.  Seems to even work somewhat on some small subset
	of the world's computers.

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (net_class_pre_process): If there
	is an address, set the net.address property to it, regardless of
	what type of net device it is.
	(net_class_accept): Added.  Allows us to have net class devices
	without an associated sysdevice.  Only allow it if it's an
	ethernet device for now.
	(net_class_compute_udi): Added.  Needed in situations where the
	class device has no sysdevice, we need to generate a UDI since we
	aren't merging onto a parent device.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: Reenable the ieee1394 class device
	handlers.
	(osspec_probe): Create a fake root device to be the parent for all
	of our sysdevice-less devices.  It's a virtual device, has the UDI
	"/org/freedesktop/Hal/devices/fakeroot", and the sysfs path device
	of "(none)".

	* tools/device-manager/Const.py.in (BUS_NAMES): Add "unknown" to
	the list of known bus names.
	
2004-05-25  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* configure.in: Bump to 0.2.91

	* packaging/fedora/hal.spec: Bump to 0.2.91

2004-05-25  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (read_etc_mtab): hal doesn't
	close the filedescriptor when it /etc/mtab wasn't changed of the
	fstat failed. Also when closing a file stream opened with fdopen,
	the original fd is also closed (the fdopen function doesn't dup
	the fd). So the close after fclose is wrong. Patch from Sjoerd
	Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.
	(detect_fs): When fs detection fails the volume_id struct wasn't
	closed, causing a mem and fd leak. And as a side effect, causing
	me to be unable to open my cd writer with the eject button when
	there was a blank cd inside :). Patch from Sjoerd Simons
	<sjoerd@luon.net>.

2004-05-18  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* tools/callouts/fstab-update.sh: Use /media as long as it's there
	and /mnt doesn't exist.  Otherwise fallback to /mnt.  Should
	happily work on all distros.  Patch from Sjoerd Simons
	<sjoerd@luon.net>.

2004-05-17  Joe Shaw  <joeshaw@novell.com>

	* tools/callouts/fstab-update.sh: Guard against the script being
	killed mid-execution by doing all the updates in a copy and then
	moving it over later on add.  Patch from Martin Waitz
	<tali@admingilde.org>.

2004-05-15  Owen Fraser-Green  <owen@discobabe.net>

	* packaging/fedora/hal.spec: bump version to 0.2.90, D-BUS version
	bump, PreReq change to include useradd and include hal.dev. Also
	changed ${foo} variables to %{foo}.
	
2004-05-13  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c 
	(detect_media): Move disc properties into volume.disc.* namespace and
	only set them for optical discs. Use disc_is_appendable() to set 
	volume.disc.is_appendable. Specifically, the following properties
	are now available for discs (e.g. iff volume.is_disc is TRUE)

	volume.disc.has_audio      - TRUE iff the disc got audio tracks
	volume.disc.has_data       - TRUE iff the disc got data tracks
	volume.disc.is_appendable  - TRUE iff further data can be written
	volume.disc.is_blank       - TRUE iff the data is blank 
	volume.disc.is_rewriteable - TRUE iff the disc can be reformatted
	volume.disc.type           - type of disc, can assume "cd_rom", "cd_r",
	                             "cd_rw", "dvd_rom", dvd_r", "dvd_rw",
	                             "dvd_ram", "dvd_plus_r", "dvd_plus_rw"

	(block_class_pre_process): Don't set volume.disc_type, but set the
	boolean property volume.is_disc.

	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c (disc_is_appendable): new function

2004-05-09  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.h: 
	s/get_dvd_media_type/get_disc_type/

	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c (get_dvd_media_type):
	s/get_dvd_media_type/get_disc_type/

2004-05-13  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Connect to the
	"callouts_finished" signal and call the callouts rather than
	removing the volume from the GDL here.  Patch from Sjoerd Simons
	<sjoerd@luon.net>

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (mdio_read): Make the result an
	out parameter and return 0 on success and -1 on failure.
	(mii_get_rate): Check the result of mdio_read().  Put the check
	for whether it's 10mbit in an else-if.
	(mii_get_link): Check the result of mdio_read().  Based on a patch
	from Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>

2004-05-08  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* tools/callouts/fstab-update.sh: Improve the locking loop.

2004-05-07  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* NEWS: Update the udev requirements.  Patch rom Kay Sievers
	<kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* doc/TODO: Add an item about clean daemon shutdown.

	* tools/callouts/fstab-update.sh: Add locking on the fstab so
	things don't race for it.  Timeout after 10 seconds.  Also be
	overly cautious about when we remove the block device from the
	fstab and check to make sure that the resulting fstab exists and
	is larger than 0 bytes in size.

2004-05-05  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/linux_dvd_rw_utils.c (get_dvd_media_type): new function

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c: rename some properties and ensure
	that all properties for a namespace is always available with default
	values - it's easiest to look at the diff to see what's changed; one
	highlight is the introduction of the volume.* namespace.
	(detect_media): use new utility in linux_dvd_rw_utils.c to get the
	disc type for DVD's.

	* tools/callouts/fstab-update.sh: property names changed

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.c (probe_jfs): test for js == NULL

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): call detect_fs
	when adding a disc. Also route the child through the TDL and test
	the TDL so we don't add more than one child now that we've got a
	delay thanks to callouts.
	(add_to_gdl): rename to disc_add_to_gdl, since we use it only for
	optical discs

2004-05-04  Kay Sievers  <kay.sievers@vrfy.org>

	* hald/linux/volume_id/volume_id.[ch] : support reading of iso9660

	stuff; don't install timeout for waiting for child

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_detection_done): removed

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c (bus_device_detection_done): removed

2004-04-30  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (block_class_pre_process):
	Process the mtab here, so that our fstype and mount_point
	properties are set.

	* hald/linux/bus_device.h, hald/linux/class_device.h: Remove the

	the detection_done functions.

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (foreach_device_by_capability): Make sure caps

	* hald/hald.c (gdl_store_changed): Don't call hal_callout_device()
	in the removed case.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (remove_callouts_finished): Actually remove
	the device from the GDL in this callback.
	(remove_device, remove_class_device): Connect to the
	callouts_finished signal and call device callouts instead of
	removing it from the GDL here.

2004-04-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/callout.c (hal_callout_device): We still need to emit the
	callouts_finished signal even if we have no callouts.  Whoops.

	* hald/bus_device.c (bus_device_got_parent): We don't need to ref
	the device being added, since it's no longer unconditionally being
	unreffed immediately afterward.

	* hald/class_device.c (class_device_final): Ditto.

	* hald/common.c (device_move_from_tdl_to_gdl): Remove the ref note
	in the comment, and call g_object_ref() at the top of the
	function.

2004-04-26  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	device is removed

2004-04-26  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/device.c (hal_device_print): Print out to stderr instead of
	stdout.

	* hald/device_store.c (hal_device_store_print): Print out the
	contents of a HalDeviceStore.

	* hald/linux/common.c (rename_and_merge): Check to see if the UDI

2004-04-26  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/callout.c: Make pending callouts a hash table of lists, so
	we can execute all the callouts for the devices in order.
	(add_pending_callout, pop_pending_callout): New convenience
	functions.
	(wait_for_callout): If this is the last callout for a device, fire
	off the callouts_finished signal on the device.
	(hal_callout_device, hal_callout_capability,
	hal_callout_property): Use the new convenience functions, call
	process_callouts() in an idle function.

	* hald/device.c: Add a "callouts_finished" signal.

	* hald/hald.c (gdl_store_changed): Don't call hal_callout_device()
	here anymore... we call it in the backend before we get added to
	the GDL.

	* hald/hald_dbus.c (manager_device_exists,
	device_get_all_properties, device_get_property,
	device_get_property_type, device_set_property,

	agent_merge_properties, agent_device_matches): Search the TDL for
	the provided UDI if it's not found in the GDL.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c (detect_media): Instead of
	adding the device to the GDL immediately, connect to the

	hal_callout_device() here, though.

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c (bus_device_got_parent): Ditto.

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_final): Ditto.

	* hald/linux/common.c (device_move_from_tdl_to_gdl): Remove the
	device from the TDL and add it to the GDL.  Remove the signal
	handler and unref the device.  Used as a callback from
	bus_device.c and class_device.c.

2004-04-26  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/macio_bus_device.c: new file because with the recent
	change in how probing is handled, my CD-ROM wasn't added until 30
	seconds late into the process as the macio glue wasn't handled

	* hald/Makefile.am (hald_SOURCES): add linux/macio_bus_device.c

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: add macio_bus_handler to bus_device_handlers

	* tools/device-manager/Const.py.in (BUS_NAMES): Add macio mapping

2004-04-25  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* doc/TODO: Add our notes about current issues with the Linux 2.6
	kernel

	* hald/linux/usbif_bus_device.c (usbif_device_accept): remove 
	is_probing

	* hald/linux/usb_bus_device.c (usb_device_accept): remove is_probing

	* hald/linux/printer_class_device.c (printer_class_device_accept): 
	remove is_probing

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (visit_class_device): optionally take and use
	a ClassDeviceHandler object
	(visit_class): -do-
	(visit_device): optionally take and use a BusDeviceHandler object
	(visit_bus): new function; not currently used
	(osspec_probe): add a comment about migration to visit_bus once the
	kernel is ready; slight changes

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c (net_class_pre_process): set category
	and capabilities

	* hald/linux/ide_host_bus_device.c (ide_host_device_accept): remove
	is_probing

	* hald/linux/common.c (got_parent): new function

	* hald/linux/class_device.h: change prototypes by removing is_probing
	parameter

	* hald/linux/class_device.c don't pass is_probing; use 
	hald_is_initialising global instead

	* hald/linux/bus_device.h: change prototypes by removing is_probing
	parameter

	* hald/linux/bus_device.c: don't pass is_probing; use the global
	hald_is_initialising instead. Don't try to find parent if the sysfs
	path indicates that there is no parent.

	* hald/linux/block_class_device.c : don't pass is_probing; use 
	hald_is_initialising global

2004-04-22  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/usb_bus_device.c (usb_add_caps_from_class): don't set
	capabilities from device class since this is very misleading.
	In fact, capabilities should only stem from kernel- or userspace-
	drivers. We retain the right to set the usbhub capability as no
	kernel driver is bound to this class of devices. Yet.. who knows?
	In either case, a GUI device browsers can always inspect the info.bus
	and consult the appropriate stuff, e.g. the usb.device_class, 
	_sub_class and _protocol deal for usb devices, to select an appropriate
	icon.

	* hald/linux/pci_bus_device.c (pci_add_caps_from_class): removed for
	same reasons as above
	(pci_device_pre_process): don't call pci_add_caps_from_class

	* tools/device-manager/Representation.py:
	s/bridge.cardbus/pcmcia_socket/

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: add pcmcia_socket_class_handler

	* hald/linux/pcmcia_socket_class_device.c: new file; very simple just
	tag a busdevice with the capability pcmcia_socket

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_final): log an informative
	message when we merge onto a device

2004-04-22  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_got_sysdevice): Instead
	of refusing to merge onto a socalled virtual device (which is really
	a HAL term, and thus quite crackful), just special-case the fact
	that we don't want to merge onto a usb interface but we prefer to
	merge onto the usb device. Which is sane and quite nice. 
	This makes the scsi_device receive the scsi_generic class stuff and
	thus the scsi_generic.device_file=sg0 property. Which is also sane
	and quite nice (think SCSI multi-lun devices).

	* hald/linux/osspec.c (remove_class_device): Make a more concise
	statement in the log message about the fact that removal of class
	devices is not yet implemented; add @todo tag so this is not
	forgotten

	* doc/TODO: Add note about removal of class devices

2004-04-21  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* doc/TODO: Add a couple of callout-related items.

	* hald/callout.c (process_callouts): Reallocate the envp here with
	enough space for all of the properties, since properties were
	probably added since we initially measured the space.
	(hal_callout_device, hal_callout_capability,
	hal_callout_property): Reenable these.  Don't bother counting the
	number of properties here, it doesn't matter.  Instead allocate
	just enough space for our special env vars and let
	process_callouts() deal with the rest.

2004-04-21  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* hald/callout.c
	(hal_callout_property): callouts seem to be a bit broken right 
	now (segfaults my box etc.), so disable them. Hopefully this is
	fixed soon!
	(hal_callout_capability): -do-
	(hal_callout_device): -do

	* hald/linux/usbif_bus_device.c (usbif_device_compute_udi): Don't
	print details about the device

	* hald/linux/usb_bus_device.c (usb_proc_parse): Comment out noisy
	print statements

	* hald/linux/osspec.c 
	(handle_udev_node_created_found_device): 
	(visit_class_device): clean up logging statements
	(visit_device): -do-
	(remove_device): comment out noisy logging statements
	(remove_class_device): -do-
	(handle_hotplug): -do-


	* hald/linux/class_device.c 
	(class_device_got_device_file): comment out noisy logging statement
	(class_device_accept): -do-

	* hald/linux/common.c 
	(rename_and_merge): comment out noisy logging statements
	(class_device_get_device_file): -do-

	* hald/hald.c (gdl_store_changed): don't print device, just print
	the UDI

	* hald/callout.c: add property modified callout;
	  change the action parameter to a tri-state and add appropriate enum
	* hald/callout.h: add prototype for hal_property_callout
	* hald/hald.c: invoke hal_property_callout on property modification

2004-04-20  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	* doc/TODO (CVSID): Updated

2004-04-20  Robert Love  <rml@ximian.com>

	* hald/callout.c: hal_property_get_as_string is now to_string, fix
	leak.
	* hald/device.c: add hal_device_property_to_string
	* hald/device.h: add prototype for hal_device_property_to_string
	* hald/property.c: rename hal_property_get_as_string to to_string
	* hald/property.h: ditto for the prototype

2004-04-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/callout.c (Callout): Add the HalDevice to the structure, we
	need it for getting the properties.  Add the starting index for
	the envp.
	(add_property_to_env): Deal with Callout structs instead of
	ForeachPropInfo.
	(process_callouts): Add the properties to the environment here, at
	callout time, instead of up front, since callouts may have changed
	properties, and we want later callouts to have the most up-to-date
	info.
	(process_callouts): Change the idle to a timeout.  This is a
	copout.

2004-04-20  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/callout.c: Rework this some to make the callouts
	asynchronous and tied in with the main loop, so that callouts can
	either link against libhal or use hal-{get|set}-property without
	deadlocking.

2004-04-19  Robert Love  <rml@ximian.com>

	* hald/callout.c (hal_callout_capability): add properties to 
	environment and set working directory correctly

2004-04-15  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/device.c (hal_device_async_wait_property): Ref the device
	when we create the AsyncInfo.  This should fix the glib warnings
	about signals.
	(destroy_async_match_info): Unref it when we're finished.

2004-04-14  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/Makefile.am: Build the new scsi_generic class handler.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: Add scsi_generic_class_handler.  Also add a
	comment about how the order of the class_device_handlers array is
	important, particularly when probing at startup.

	* hald/linux/scsi_generic_class_device.c: Added.  The actual
	handler.  The dumbest and most straightforward backend yet.

	* tools/linux/hal_hotplug.c: Add file_list_scsi_generic.
	(wait_for_sysfs_info): And add it here...

2004-04-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* tools/device-manager/DeviceManager.py: Wrap the gnome.ui import
	in a try statement and desensitize the About menu item if it
	fails.  This is to work around a broken python-gnome package on
	SUSE 9.0.

2004-04-12  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* hald/Makefile.am: Build the new net class device.

	* hald/linux/*.c: Change "post_process" to "pre_process", since
	we're actually doing all of this before our HalDevice merges into
	a superior one or gets added to the GDL.

	* hald/linux/class_device.h (ClassDeviceHandler): Add a new
	handler, "post_merge", which is called after we merge devices in
	class_device_final().

	* hald/linux/class_device.c (class_device_final): Call our new
	post_merge function after we've merged devices.

	* hald/linux/net_class_device.c: Add back in network class device
	support.  Uses MII registers to get the initial link state and
	uses netlink sockets to update it in real-time.

	* hald/linux/osspec.c: Add net_class_handler.

2004-04-12  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

2004-03-14  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Added first stab of rewrite of linux specific parts - the new
	code is a lot more object oriented and thus more compact; it's
	currently disabled until it's more tested; you have to manually
	enable by editing hald/Makefile.am

	* hald/Makefile.am (hald_SOURCES): Add new linux specific parts;
	currently disabled
	
	* hald/device_store.h: add ds_device_async_wait_for_property()

	as candidate for location of udevinfo

2004-03-03  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Major reformatting patch - seems that everyone is following
	another coding style than me so I chose the GNOME coding guidelines,
	indent -kr -i8 -pcs -lps -psl, and did some manual reformatting

2004-03-01  Joe Shaw  <joe@ximian.com>

	* configure.in: SUSE puts pci.ids in /usr/share, so add that to
	the list of directories to check.

	* tools/Makefile.am: Use @PACKAGE_LIBS@ and @DBUS_LIBS@ instead of
	referencing the libs directly.  This allows us to have dbus and/or
	glib in a prefix.

2004-03-01  David Zeuthen  <david@fubar.dk>

	Preliminary support for waiting for sysfs information to appear - 
	not complete but it's a start...

	simply more efficient having a single daemon and, more
	importantly, it's easier to manage. The monitoring code still

	from BitKeeper with D-BUS enabled (got the patch accepted today)
